It harms our communities, by spreading hate through misleading claims. It hurts our democracy, by damaging trust in politicians and political processes. It leads to bad decisions, by disrupting public debate on the issues that most affect us, including climate change and public spending', 'Since 2015, we have been developing technology to help increase the speed, scale and impact of our and others fact checking. Our goal is to create a global collaborative effort to help media outlets, civil society, platforms and public policy makers better understand the landscape, and to bring the benefits of those tools to everyone by working in partnership.', 'We launched our roadmap The State of Automated Fact Checking in August 2016, where we set out a plan for making fact checking dramatically more effective using existing technology. In autumn of that year we were one of the first UK organisations to use the ‚ÄúFact Check‚Äù label in Google news.', 'In November 2016, we announced support from Google‚Äôs Digital News Initiative for the first stages of our automated fact checking work, and we‚Äôre grateful for vital support from hosting experts Bytemark and open source search specialists Flax too. This funding helped build our first prototypes. In May 2019 we ‚Äì along with Africa Check, Chequeado and the Open Data Institute ‚Äì won the Google AI Impact Challenge. We are just one of 20 international winners, chosen from more than 2,600 entrants. Over the next three years, with Google‚Äôs support, we will use machine learning to dramatically improve and scale fact checking, working with international experts to define how artificial intelligence could transform this work, to develop new tools and to deploy and evaluate them.', 'We have made a set of tools designed to alleviate the pain points we experience in the fact checking process. As fact checkers with ten years experience, we understand the operational advantages these tools can bring, making us uniquely placed to build them.', 'We are not attempting to replace fact checkers with technology, but to empower fact checkers with the best tools. We expect most fact checks to be completed by a highly trained human, but we want to use technology to help:', 'Across a suite of products, our technology does the following tasks:', 'We start by collecting a range of data from leading news sites and social media platforms that may contain claims we want to fact check. Data we collect can be taken from speech on live TV, online news sites, and social media pages. We are able to add new monitoring inputs for fact checkers in other countries and have done so already for a number of countries in Africa.', 'Once we have all the input information available as text we split everything down to individual sentences, which are our atomic unit for fact checks. The sentences are then passed through a number of steps to enrich them and make them more and more useful in the process of fact checking.', 'We define a claim as the checkable part of any sentence which is made by a politician, journalist or online.', 'There are many different types of claims - ranging from claims about quantities (‚ÄúGDP has risen by x%‚Äù), claims about cause and effect (‚Äúthis policy leads to y‚Äù), predictive claims about the future (‚Äúthe economy will grow by z‚Äù) and more.', 'We have developed a claim-type classifier to guide fact checkers towards claims that might be worth investigating. It helps us to identify and label every new sentence according to what type of claim it contains (whether it is about cause and effect, quantities, etc.).', 'We started building this with the recent BERT model published by Google Research and fine-tuned it using our own annotated data. BERT is a tool released by Google Research that has been pre trained with hundreds of millions of sentences in over 100 languages. This makes it a broad statistical model of language as it is actually used.', 'Labelling claims in this way filters the volume of data we could fact check from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands. It is a vital first step in ensuring that the users of our tools have a chance to make sense of all the information.', 'Once we have labelled claims, sentences are checked to see if they are a match to something we have previously fact checked. Some claims are easier to model than others due to specificity and ambiguity in the language used to describe them.', 'The plan is to train a BERT-style model to predict match/no-match for sentences and then add in entity analysis (e.g. count if both sentences contain the sample numbers, people, organizations etc.). In combination, we hope these two stages will find repeats of a claim even if different words are used to describe it', 'Additionally, we semantically enrich the content to help our model detect semantically similar words and phrases. The first step is to identify people, places and other valuable entities, identifying the entities of interest and matching them to external URIs. We then deduplicate the information across multiple sentences, to identify and group together semantically similar references (e.g. ‚Äòthe prime minister‚Äô and ‚ÄòBoris Johnson‚Äô). This allows us to extract greater value from the data we process and means we can make sophisticated interfaces showing all statements made by individuals. We currently use wikidata via Google big query to power this service.', 'Finally, we use external processes to help spot more claims and further identify patterns of language that can be automatically checked.', 'Given a sentence, our tool attempts to identify the topic, trend, values, dates and location. If that succeeds, it compares the extracted information with the corresponding data via the UK Office For National Statistics API. It knows about 15 topics and c.60 verbs that define trends (e.g. rising, falling). This means our technology can automatically match with significantly more data to identify whether it‚Äôs correct.', 'The fact checking process is often undertaken offline. We then publish the results on our website. We also describe each fact check with some very specific markup, called ClaimReview. This is part of the wider schema.org project. It describes content on a range of topics in domain specific terms. This is important for us as describing our content so specifically helps ensure that our fact checks can travel further than our own platforms. Fact checks can form a vital part of the web. Just over 60,000 fact checks exist in the Google Fact Check Explorer and these were seen over 4 billion times in 2019 in Google Search alone.', ""We are careful not to overstate our results. There are a lot of people who say that artificial intelligence and machine learning is a panacea, but we have been at the front lines of fact checking since 2010, we know how difficult fact checking is first hand. Humans aren't going anywhere anytime soon‚Äîand nor would we want them to be."", 'Our automated fact checking team is made up of:', 'We need support and funding to develop this work further.

This gives us data from nearly:', 'Every time clients get help from their local Citizens Advice ‚Äî there are more than 280 across England and Wales ‚Äî our trained advisers record information about the problems they‚Äôre helping with on Casebook ‚Äî our new case recording tool.', 'This means we know how many clients we see, who they are and the main problems they face.', 'So all in all, we have a lot of data.', 'This gives us unparalleled insight into the problems people are facing, and is really valuable to our policy, campaigns and media work.', 'If we use it well we can influence key stakeholders to make important changes for our clients. But to make the most of our data, we‚Äôve realised how important it is to present it well.', 'As part of introducing Casebook, we wanted the ability to produce reports that are accessible, visually engaging and interactive. We wanted to present our data in a way that would work for our network of local Citizens Advice, our staff and external stakeholders. The solution needed to be flexible, secure, easy to use, fast to implement and affordable.', 'Tableau, as a leader in data analytics, fitted the bill.', 'We started with Advice Trends and Consumer Advice Trends. These are interactive datasets that can be accessed by anyone. We went from providing flat Excel files and Word documents to rich and complex datasets which allow people to filter and interact with our data.', 'Our trend reports include data on who we‚Äôve helped and with what problems. For example, Advice Trends shows we helped over 170,000 people with personal independence payment (PIP) issues in the past 12 months, making it the biggest advice issue.', 'On the consumer side, in the past year we helped people with 110,281 house fittings and appliances issues, 104,047 transport issues and 49,457 personal goods and services issues.', 'Our Consumer Advice Trends also includes filters and local authority maps to show in which areas of the country issues are affecting people most.', 'We‚Äôve also published a number of Google Data Studio files, which can be accessed by national and local Citizens Advice. These files are similar to Tableau in that they allow users to interact with our data but are better suited to use alongside Google Analytics.', 'There are dashboards for each issue type, like debt, benefits and housing. This gives a very rich way to explore data and will include insights not previously published, such as client profile, mobile or laptop access, top pages viewed with trends per page.', 'We‚Äôve also changed the way we count page views. We now only count these where a client has spent at least 30 seconds on the page.', 'So we now have comprehensive reports for external and internal stakeholders to explore our data and report back to funders.', 'But we‚Äôre continuing to explore how we can gain even more insights through our data, engaging with our users and building on the tools we have.', 'We‚Äôll be working on new tools for our quality framework, new reports on our Money Advice Service and looking at other areas of our business which could benefit from making better use of our data.', 'If you have any questions or comments please contact datateam@citizensadvice.org.uk', ""We help people find a way forward.

Last month, a group of 35 designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs from all over the world gathered in Oakland, California. Together, we are working on the creation of tools, strategies, and networks to build a new collaborative commons.', 'Our group consisted of founders and key contributors from Enspiral, Loomio, CoBudget, Chalkle, Robin Hood Cooperative, Identity.com, Hylo, Ethereum, Citizen Code, Metamaps.cc, Bitmind.co, KiwiConnect, Lifehack, Planetwork, Impact Hub, Refugio Resource, Pyxis, Triaxiom9, CivicMakers and more. With us in spirit were our friends from Backfeed, CredEx, Village Lab, Ceptr, and Swarm.', 'We are united by the vision that people can do more, together, and are stewarding tools, communities, processes, networks and ecosystems to make that vision a reality.', 'To that end, we are all working on the same project. Because we‚Äôre all unique, we bring different gifts, talents, and approaches to this shared intention.', 'In the gathering, we sensed a possible harmony and collaboration, where each of us working on something that is radically unique to us, for the benefit of the whole. As we began to consciously uncover this harmony amongst our intention-aligned and disparate initiatives, we recognized that we can do more together, together.', 'From the personal power of a charismatic leader, to the threat of job loss, censure, or punishment, coordinating the actions of many toward a goal or purpose has often involved external rewards, hierarchy, force, and coercion: all different forms extrinsic motivations.', 'As human consciousness grows more complex, individuals tend to be drawn toward more intrinsic and collaborative motivations, and the unique expression of the gifts that each individual has to bring. In this emerging environment, organizations and networks become more porous, initiatives are often lighter-weight, and more energy is put into finding synergies, stacked-benefits, best practices, and the harmonization of complex ecosystems of individuals and initiatives.', 'When we recognize our shared purpose throughout the diversity of our initiatives, it becomes helpful to use software tools to coordinate and sensemake in the large, values aligned collectives that we‚Äôre beginning to see in our increasingly connected and collaborative world.', 'All around us we are watching the power of software to transform communities. Any-to-many communication via the web is now within reach of nearly half of the world‚Äôs population, and growing.', 'Currently, our largest social media platforms are closed source, privately funded, and generally designed to maximize screen time for viewing ads and data collection for selling to third-parties. While on balance they provide tremendous benefit to many, I know that we can do better. We must.', 'We envision the future of the social web as an ecosystem of collaborative tools designed to enable communities, guilds, and loosely affiliated groups everywhere to collaborate, share resources, sensemake and create at a scale. These tools will rise as a way to stabilize and rejuvenate the commons, and more efficiently distribute resources to the parts of the network that need them most, rather than concentrating the resources in the hands of a few.', 'As collaboration and resource-sharing between individuals, organizations, and silos becomes easier, the boundaries between our communities will become more porous, and the transaction costs and friction that gave rise to the era of the large corporations and bureaucracies will begin to dissipate. We can begin to consciously experience ourselves as participating in a single project.', 'A key challenge that communities face when its members want to adopt a collaborative software tool is that often Metcalfe‚Äôs Law (that the value of a network increases with the square of the number of participants) doesn‚Äôt apply. In community software tools if only a small subset of the community joins, the tool is not valuable, and may even be a hindrance to productivity. However, if a critical mass of community members join, then the collaborative software tool can become extremely valuable. Steve Hardt calls this ‚ÄúGroup Atomic Network Effects.‚Äù', 'There is a particular challenge with communities that grow to have more complex needs than a single tool can provide. Community managers sometimes speak of ‚Äútool fatigue,‚Äù which arises when a community is asked to adopt multiple software tools. If any one of these tools does not reach a critical mass they quickly become useless, and that function, however critical it might be, is lost.', 'There are currently a number of easy-to-use, user-experience first, collaborative software tools that are open-source, peer-to-peer licensed, and designed to benefit the commons.', 'Some are created by social enterprises, some are non-profits, some are informal projects. While their forms are different, what unites them is their intention to benefit the commons. However they are currently not well linked together.', 'A solution to the ‚Äútool fatigue‚Äù challenge lies in creating interoperability amongst these tools, and protocols for allowing the creation and integration of more tools. This way we can begin to knit together into a flexible, collaborative open social web ‚Äî facilitating the creation of a culture of creativity, collaboration, and mutual support, for the rejuvenation of the commons ‚Äî at the scale required for a connected and collaborative humanity.', 'An ecosystem of tools that interoperate will allow communities to choose the tools that are right for them, and leave aside those that aren‚Äôt. It will allow experimentation and uncommon use cases, and will enable individual tools to specialize ‚Äî focusing on building the best user experience for specific user actions.', 'At the gathering we agreed that the core challenge is to create a coherent user experience that crosses between the various functions of the ecosystem of interoperable tools. We began exploring a number of approaches to solving some of these challenges.', 'As Jef Raskin and others have noted, ‚ÄúAs far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product.‚Äù While stacking a series of complex tools and functions on each other and requiring users to learn these systems might work in an enterprise context, where people are compelled by their job responsibilities to use all the required tools, in an environment of loose alliances, distributed networks, guilds, and movements, we have to work with intrinsic motivations, dramatically varying commitment levels and time availability. In this context, any boundaries to productive contribution become exclusionary, which is counter to creating a movement of inclusion and participation.', 'For our vision of sophisticated technological interoperability to be real, where tools are passing data to other tools, group authentication is managed by one tool for an other, data is exportable, people are managing budgets in one tool, and making important decisions in another; for it to work, it has to feel easy, fun, simple, obvious; it has to feel like play.', 'By the end of our gathering, we had coalesced around a number of the problems, the needs, and the specifics of our vision, and the Collaborative Technology Alliance was seeded. This group will create (and adopt when already available) standards, schemas, and protocols to enable interoperability amongst collaborative software tools. This group will also promote user-centered design amongst our member tools, and help to generate a common UI/design language for the ecosystem towards this end.', 'Here are a number of areas that we have decided are critical to this collaborative ecosystem.', 'If this vision inspires you, please join us.

Tactical Data Engagement (TDE) helps data providers like city governments provide better open data and public information that‚Äôs tailored to community needs.', 'This guide aims to help cities engage nontechnical community members on data-driven policymaking, supplementing the Action phase of TDE. It is meant to be applied during the implementation stage of an open data project, after cities have used TDE to find and refine use cases for open data.', 'We designed playbooks to help jumpstart community action, providing stories about how open data advocates have co-designed, collaborated, and solved problems together using open data. The first playbook on Data User Groups was released in October 2017, and the second featured Open Data Scope-a-thons. This playbook is the third in our series. Playbooks are versatile, just like the rest of the TDE approach, and should be used creatively.', 'Community Data Dialogues are in-person events designed to share open data with community members in the most digestible way possible to start a conversation about a specific issue. The main goal of the event is to give residents who may not have technical expertise but have local experience  a chance to participate in data-informed decision-making. Doing this work in-person can open doors and let facilitators ask a broader range of questions. To achieve this, the event must be designed to be inclusive of people without a background in data analysis and/or using statistics to understand local issues. Carrying out this event will let decision-makers in government use open data to talk with residents who can add to data‚Äôs value with their stories of lived experience relevant to local issues.', 'These events can take several forms, and groups both in and outside of government have designed creative and innovative events tailored to engage community members who are actively interested in helping solve local issues  but are unfamiliar with using open data. This guide will help clarify how exactly to make Community Data Dialogues non-technical, interactive events that are inclusive to all participants.', 'We‚Äôve presented a number of strategies for community engagement on open data. But they tend to attract community data users who are well-versed in reading or using data.', 'This only accounts for a portion of the larger community. Many city residents are interested in participating in government decision making, but may feel they lack the capacity or expertise to understand data that may be relevant to issues that do in fact affect their lives. To accessibly engage all local residents, governments must be creative in determining new ways to bring non-data-savvy audiences into the conversation.', 'City governments might think of Community Data Dialogues as opportunities to bring more attention and usage to open data portals and other projects that would benefit from public feedback. It‚Äôs useful for data practitioners both in and outside of government to observe how non-data users engage with the information, as if offers them a more comprehensive understanding of how nontechnical audiences understand and make use of their data.', 'Attendees will benefit from Community Data Dialogues by having an easy and non-threatening entry point into understanding how the city uses data. By marketing events as ‚Äúdialogues‚Äù and not as hacking events or data-centric activities, hosts might welcome people who are possibly threatened by overly technical messages about local issues.', 'Community members may be able to enrich existing data with their experiences of life in their communities. For instance, housing data related to new development projects may be augmented by the insights from community members living in the neighborhoods that will grow and change due to new construction. These residents may be able to comment on the quality of the projects, or on how local public spaces are actually use, or attest to the accuracy of maps of local amenities, etc. This qualitative data can bolster the accuracy and utility of the existing quantitative data used to make decisions.', 'Community organizers or civic hackers can act as facilitators for these events by helping governments design the Data Dialogues appropriately for the local community. These residents have connections within the community and leverage their networks to ensure that anyone interested has access to participate in the events.', 'Finally, governments should keep in mind the breadth of useful information to be gathered from these community events. While this playbook is framed in the context of open data work, public feedback can and should be sought out to inform policy, encourage democratic participation, gain insight on public perception of current projects, etc.', '', 'A number of groups both in and outside of government have facilitated accessible open data events to great success. Here are just a few examples from the field of what data-focused events tailored for a nontechnical audience can look like:', 'Data Days Cleveland is an annual one-day event designed to make data accessible to all. Programs are designed with inclusivity and learning in mind, making it a more welcoming space for people new to data work. Data experts and practitioners direct novices on the fundamentals of using data: making maps, reading spreadsheets, creating data visualizations, etc. April Hirsh, one of the founders of Data Days CLE, detailed the importance of data accessibility and bringing lived experiences into data-centered coversations.', 'From an article published on cleveland.com:', 'Data Days CLE was born four years ago in response to a growing urgency to make data more publicly accessible and to transparently include data in civic decision-making.', 'What began as a small meetup inside a City Hall archival library has since grown into a regional movement, drawing in hundreds of data experts, advocates and dreamers who see data as an engine for building equity, reducing bias and creating accountability, according to Taylor Henschel, co-chair of the event and Microsoft Civic Innovation Fellow.', 'Lesson: Partnering with open data expert groups to upskill community members and advocates on data analysis can help them use cities‚Äô open data offerings more effectively.\xa0', 'The Urban Institute‚Äôs Data Walks are an innovative example of presenting data in an interactive and accessible way to communities. Data Walks are events gathering community residents, policymakers, and others to jointly review and analyze data presentations on specific programs or issues and collaborate to offer feedback based on their individual experiences and expertise. This feedback can be used to improve current projects and inform future policies.', 'From an Urban Institute blog post on beta-testing Data Walks on their Housing Opportunity and Services Together (HOST) project:', 'We‚Äôre constantly evaluating new strategies to figure out what works. Our latest experiment: a ‚Äúdata walk‚Äù for residents of Altgeld Gardens, a public housing community and HOST site on Chicago‚Äôs South Side. Though our work is informed by residents‚Äô experiences, residents aren‚Äôt typically involved in the ongoing data collection process. This time, though, we shared baseline survey and administrative data to hear what residents thought of the initiative and to learn what areas our data are not addressing. We are using their input to guide service provision for the remainder of the demonstration.', 'Community engagement in Altgeld Gardens is notoriously difficult, so we were prepared for the worst. But we worked hard with on-the-ground HOST staff to recruit families to participate and did our best to present the information in a user-friendly and engaging format. Ultimately, 28 adult residents and 8 HOST staff participated in our event‚Äîa great success in the Altgeld community. Here‚Äôs what we learned.', 'Our baseline survey revealed heartbreaking facts about food insecurity and hunger in Altgeld Gardens. About half of respondents didn‚Äôt have enough food to last the month or worried that their food supply would run out. One-fifth of residents had to cut the size of their meals to make food last longer.', 'It was shocking to hear responses from HOST staff and families; most felt the numbers should have been higher, indicating that food insecurity and hunger are more prevalent in the community than we expected.', 'Many adults reported that their children‚Äôs HOST experiences motivated them to engage in HOST services themselves.\nWhat resonated most for HOST adults and youth was being recognized for accomplishing their goals. As one case manager noted, ‚ÄúWe had an event that was solely focused on the adults‚Äîthey received awards and things of that nature‚Äîand afterward, my client came up to me and cried and said she had never been acknowledged like that.‚Äù We learned that whole family participation and recognition for reaching goals were huge motivating factors in getting HOST adults to take advantage of available services.', 'Lesson: Targeted outreach to ensure inclusivity in events can lead to critical insights that can be used to improve efficacy of policies and programs.', 'Read the full report\xa0¬ª', '', 'Community Data Dialogues must prioritize inclusivity and accessibility above all else.

Some examples of questions to consider:', 'When planning the event itself, there are several steps organizers can take to ensure the event is as well-run and impactful as can be:', 'Design accessible data visualizations/statistics', 'Preparation is key to ensuring impactful Community Data Dialogues. Data experts can work with communications or advocacy professionals to ensure their visualizations are clear, concise, and accessible. They should also work together to imagine the best ways of presenting their information and facilitating a discussion that respects the views of all attendees while still accomplishing the goals of the Dialogue. Organizers should think creatively of the best ways to publicize these events in their specific city contexts and how they might incentivize attendance. Looping in residents regularly engaged in the community can help.', 'Focus on facilitation', 'Good facilitation means letting everyone have a chance to speak and ensuring that presentations or signage are as jargon-free as possible. Facilitating well should provide an opportunity to make people from a variety of backgrounds feel comfortable and ready to participate. Organizers can read up on effective, inclusive facilitation, design, or work directly with experts in the field to facilitate the event.', 'Our Data User Groups playbook is a great resource for conveners, with a number of tips for effective meetings and some guiding principles for bringing people together to collaborate on data.', 'Close feedback loops', 'Make sure to do something with documented feedback, as it‚Äôs important for local governments to be responsive. People learn to trust by seeing that action was taken, and follow through on feedback will help encourage more people to participate in future convenings. Ideally, post feedback online and describe what actions were taken.', 'In conclusion, there are a multitude of ways cities and open data advocates and organizations can engage non-technical residents in understanding local data and using it to inform public policy. Creativity and flexibility are pivotal in the design of inclusive analog events, and, done well, they exemplify some of the robust, inclusive methods of community engagement seen today. Organizers should be sure to document key takeaways and insights from the events, as well as asking for community feedback to inform future iterations, helping to ensure they remain useful and impactful for all parties.\xa0']","['https://sunlightfoundation.com/', 'https://communities.sunlightfoundation.com/methodology/', 'https://sunlight-foundation.gitbooks.io/playbook-data-user-groups/content/home.html', 'https://sunlight-open-cities.gitbook.io/playbook-open-data-scope-a-thon/', 'https://www.datadayscle.org/', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/2019/09/25/thinking-outside-the-box-on-data-users-engaging-non-technical-audiences-in-open-data-work/', 'https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2019/03/data-days-cle-engages-community-in-effort-to-make-data-accessible-open-offers-training-april-15.html?fbclid=IwAR0XENcOx1vYrUqeldh7vnC7f55Zsd8Xhbjmaq53nSwlInCSTJoRpUDfscU', 'https://www.urban.org/research/publication/data-walks-innovative-way-share-data-communities', 'https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/collecting-better-data-communitys-help', 'https://www.urban.org/research/publication/data-walks-innovative-way-share-data-communities', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/2019/08/13/measuring-the-impact-of-community-engagement-around-open-data/', 'http://www.facilitating.xyz/facilitators-can-infuse-diversity-inclusion-everything/', 'https://uxplanet.org/6-principles-for-inclusive-design-3e9867f7f63e', 'https://sunlight-foundation.gitbooks.io/playbook-data-user-groups/content/home.html', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/open-cities/', 'https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/', 'https://communities.sunlightfoundation.com', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/open-cities/', 'https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/']","{'gitbooks.io', 'gitbook.io', 'urban.org', 'uxplanet.org', 'bloomberg.org', 'facilitating.xyz', 'sunlightfoundation.com', 'cleveland.com', 'datadayscle.org'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intent of this initiative is to enable more effective and efficient ways of accessing, sharing and using data for public problem-solving and sustainable development.', 'Central to C4DC is the objective of demystifying the complexity of data sharing agreements. Establishing the legal provisions for a data collaborative can be time-consuming and complex. By providing both an analytical framework and an online library of legal clauses which capture the key elements involved in a data collaboration, the transaction costs and misunderstandings that often occur during the negotiating of a data collaborative can be reduced.', 'Data sharing agreements (DSAs) are written agreements that establish the terms for how data are shared between parties and are important for establishing accountability and trust. In a new C4DC report, we review the DSAs in our online library and consider how six major issues, including data use, access, breaches, proprietary issues, publicization of the analysis, and deletion of data are addressed in the agreements.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new demands for data, and many countries are engaging in emergency data sharing arrangements to understand different dimensions of the health crisis. In particular, there is growing interest in the use of mobile network operator (MNO) data for tracking population movement. In response to this, SDSN TReNDS on behalf of C4DC, has gathered and analyzed example data sharing agreements (DSAs) that have been used to share MNO data for health applications to help guide other data actors considering similar arrangements.']","['https://www.sdsntrends.org/research/dsainsightsreport', 'https://www.sdsntrends.org/covid19datasharing', 'https://www.thegovlab.org/', 'https://www.sdsntrends.org/', 'https://www.washington.edu/', 'https://www.weforum.org/']","{'sdsntrends.org', 'washington.edu', 'thegovlab.org', 'weforum.org'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We encourage all campaigns to enlist professional input from credentialed IT and cybersecurity professionals whenever possible.', '\xa0', '', 'Candidates and campaigns face a daunting array of challenges. There are events to organize, volunteers to recruit, funds to raise, and the relentless demands of the modern media cycle. Every staffer must anticipate unfortunate surprises like gaffes or a last-minute attack ad. Cyber attacks now belong on this list as well.', 'As campaigns have become increasingly digital, adversaries have found new opportunities to meddle, disrupt, and steal. In 2008, Chinese hackers infiltrated the Obama and McCain campaigns, and stole large quantities of information from both. In 2012, the Obama and Romney campaigns each faced hacking attempts against their networks and websites. In 2016, cyber operatives believed to be sponsored by Russia stole and leaked tens of thousands of emails and documents from Democratic campaign staff.', 'The consequences of a cyber breach can be substantial. News of a breach itself, compounded by a slow-drip release of stolen information, can derail a candidate‚Äôs message for months. Attackers overloading a website can lead to lost donations at key moments. The theft of personal donor data can generate significant legal liabilities and make donors reluctant to contribute to a campaign. Destructive attacks aimed at staff computers or critical campaign servers can slow down campaign operations for days or even weeks. Cleaning up the resulting mess will divert precious resources in the heat of a close race, whether it‚Äôs for president or city council.', 'For the foreseeable future, cyber threats will remain a real part of our campaign process. As democracy‚Äôs front line, campaign staff must recognize the risk of an attack, develop a strategy to reduce that risk as much as possible, and implement response strategies for that moment when the worst happens. While no campaign can achieve perfect security, taking a few simple steps can make it much harder for malicious actors to do harm. Ironically, the most sophisticated state actors often choose the least sophisticated methods of attack, preying on people and organizations who neglect basic security protocols. That is our primary reason for creating this Cybersecurity Campaign Playbook.', 'In today‚Äôs campaigns, cybersecurity is everyone‚Äôs responsibility. Human error has consistently been the root cause of publicized cyber attacks, and it‚Äôs up to the candidate and campaign leaders to weave security awareness into the culture of the organization. The decisions humans make are just as important as the software they use. Going forward, the best campaigns will have clear standards for hard work, staying on message, being loyal to the team‚Äîand following good security protocol.', 'Before we get into our recommendations, let‚Äôs quickly frame the problem:', '', 'Unfortunately for campaigns and our country, foreign adversaries may think that harming or helping a particular candidate advances their national interest, whether that means creating chaos and confusion among American voters, or punishing an official who has spoken out against them. This may sound like thriller fiction, but the reality is that a sophisticated foreign intelligence service, cybercriminal or hacktivist with a grudge against a candidate, could decide that you or someone on your campaign is a target.', 'These are the sorts of threats managers and staffers have to realize are possible.', ""WHO'S HACKING?"", 'Campaigns face information and cybersecurity threats from a wide array of actors. Lone ‚Äúblack hat‚Äù hackers and cybercriminals have tried compromising campaigns for reasons of personal gain, notoriety, or the simple desire to see if they could. Nation-states pose the most dedicated and persistent threat. Russian espionage groups known as ‚ÄúFancy Bear‚Äù (APT 28) and ‚ÄúCozy Bear‚Äù (APT 29) were implicated in the 2016 campaign hacks. The Chinese have focused much more on information gathering. They are believed to have been active in the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, but there is no evidence they released any stolen materials. The North Koreans infamously retaliated against Sony Pictures Entertainment for producing the film, The Interview, by stealing and releasing company emails and wiping their systems. Heightening tensions with the United States could prompt more attacks in the future.', '\xa0', '', 'Risk is best understood in three parts. First, there are vulnerabilities: weaknesses in your campaign that make information susceptible to theft, alteration, or destruction. Vulnerabilities can originate in hardware, software, processes, and in the vigilance level of your staff. Then there are actual threats: the nation-states, hacktivists, and other nonstate groups with the capability to exploit those vulnerabilities. Risk exists where vulnerabilities and threats meet. Lastly, there are consequences‚Äîthe impact when malicious actors capitalize on unmitigated risk.', 'There‚Äôs little you or your campaign can do to prevent threats themselves‚Äîthey are the result of larger geopolitical, economic, and social forces. What you can do is substantially reduce the likelihood that your adversaries will succeed by reducing your own vulnerability. Reducing vulnerability reduces risk‚Äîit‚Äôs up to you to decide which ones are most essential to address based on the possible consequences. For example, you may decide that the most damaging thing a hacker could do is to steal your candidate‚Äôs self research report. In response, you devote extra resources for secure cloud-based storage, use two-factor authentication, and restrict access to a small number of people. You may decide to make other documents on the campaign more widely available and less secure, since more people need them to do their jobs and they wouldn‚Äôt cause much damage if they were leaked.', 'There are technical aspects to risk mitigation, but what matters most is that you take a holistic approach. As a campaign leader, you must make fundamental choices, such as who has access to information, what information is kept or discarded, how much time you devote to security training, and how you behave as a role model. As a campaign professional, risk management is your responsibility‚Äîboth technical and human. It‚Äôs up to you to decide what data and systems are most valuable and what resources you commit to protect them.', '', 'Our security recommendations are organized according to three principles:', '', '1. Prepare: The success of nearly every one of the Playbook‚Äôs recommendations depends on the campaign manager creating a culture of security vigilance that minimizes weak links. That means establishing clear ground rules that are enforced from the top down and are embraced from the bottom up.', '', '2. Protect: Protection is critical. When you discover you have a security problem, it is already too late. Building the strongest defenses that time and money allow is key to reducing risk. Internet and data security works best in layers: there is no single, bulletproof technology or product. A few basic measures used in combination can make a campaign‚Äôs digital architecture more difficult to breach and more resilient if compromised.', '', '3. Persist: Campaigns now face adversaries with ever-increasing levels of resources and expertise; even the most vigilant culture and the toughest infrastructure may not prevent a security breach. Campaigns need to develop a plan ahead of time to deal with a breach if one occurs.', '\xa0', 'Some campaigns have more time and money for cybersecurity than others. That‚Äôs why our recommendations offer two tiers of protection: ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúenhanced.‚Äù The ‚Äúgood‚Äù tier represents everything a campaign must do to have a minimum level of security. Using the ‚Äúgood‚Äù recommendations in a piecemeal fashion will leave you vulnerable. You should always aspire to do more as time, money, and people allow, which is why we recommend using the ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù level whenever possible. If you have the resources to get reputable, trained IT support, it‚Äôs money well spent. Threats are constantly evolving and professional IT services will help get you beyond what this playbook provides and keep you abreast of the latest threats and solutions.', '\xa0', 'Management\nCampaign managers need to take responsibility for their cybersecurity strategy, but most will delegate development and supervision to a deputy or operations director. It‚Äôs important that cybersecurity is tightly integrated into HR and IT work, since correctly onboarding staff, provisioning hardware, and controlling permissions will be critical to your strategy. Many small campaigns will rely on volunteer support for IT and cybersecurity. You can use this playbook to guide your discussion with your volunteer support. The key is to carefully vet the volunteers who support you and carefully control access, so that volunteer support doesn‚Äôt create new vulnerabilities. You should make sure a campaign staffer is supervising IT work and controlling permission to access different systems.\xa0', 'When To Start \nWhatever support model you have, cybersecurity should start on Day One. What follows is a ‚Äútop five checklist‚Äù of measures that are absolutely vital. Make sure these are in place at the very beginning, even if there are just one or two staff, then complete the other ‚Äúgood‚Äù recommendations as soon as possible.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Cost', 'A lot of what we recommend here is free or very low cost. In fact, everything on our top five list is free, except getting a cloud-based platform, which will only cost a few dollars per month per employee. High target campaigns will need to budget enough resources for hardware and software to execute a responsible strategy, but this should still be a very small percentage of a multi-million dollar statewide campaign budget. Smaller campaigns will be able to execute the recommendations here for a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on how many staff or volunteers work on the campaign.', 'Any references to vendors and products are intended to help provide examples of common solutions, but do not constitute endorsements. If challenges arise when implementing products or services, we encourage you to reach out directly to the vendors, who can usually provide user-level technical assistance. When it comes to product and service selection, we encourage every campaign to consult with a cybersecurity expert or conduct independent research to find the best product for their needs.', '', 'Today‚Äôs campaigns are uniquely soft targets. They‚Äôre inherently temporary and transient. They don‚Äôt have the time or money to develop long-term, well-tested security strategies. Large numbers of new staff are often onboarded quickly without much time for training. They may bring their own hardware from home and the malware lurking on it.\xa0 Events move quickly, the stakes are high, and people feel that they don‚Äôt have time to care about cybersecurity. There are a lot of opportunities for something to go wrong.', 'At the same time, campaigns rely more and more on proprietary information about voters, donors, and public opinion. They also store sensitive documents like opposition research, vulnerability studies, personnel vetting documents, first-draft policy papers, and emails on various servers. The risks of a potential attack are increasing and so are the consequences. .', 'THE DANGER OF AN ATTACK', 'Picture this: It‚Äôs a month before Election Day, and the race is tight. You arrive at headquarters early, fire up the coffee maker, get to your desk, and log into your computer. A black screen pops up, then a gruesome cartoon of your candidate, followed by a message. Your hard drives have been wiped clean. Every digital bit of information you‚Äôve gathered‚Äîmemos, targeting lists, balance sheets‚Äîis gone. Getting it back, you read, will cost a cool million in Bitcoin and the renunciation of a major policy position.', 'An unidentified group hacked into your computer months ago, and has been quietly stealing emails, strategy memos, donors‚Äô addresses, and staffers‚Äô Social Security numbers. The group has spent weeks combing through the bounty in search of dirty laundry and created an easy-to-use website dedicated solely to distributing the highlights.

Successful cybersecurity practices depend on creating a culture of security awareness.', 'GOOD: What You Need to Do', 'Train and educate your staff to be on the lookout for phishing.\xa0 Phishing attacks against campaigns are on the rise and continue to be a primary method used by malicious actors.\xa0 Train your staff to be suspicious of any email asking for information, or claiming they need to click a link to reset their credentials. Sophisticated phishing may attacks may come from spoofed or compromised senders that appear legitimate. Encourage staffers to share anything suspicious with you or your IT staff.\xa0 The more people share, the more confident you can be that they‚Äôre being vigilant and the more intelligence you will have. The overall rule of thumb should be to ‚Äúthink before you click‚Äù, but we‚Äôve included three key points you can remind you staff about when you train and re-train.\xa0 Training should emphasize best practices such as ‚Äòhovering‚Äô over a link to identify the actual url, expanding email details to confirm the email address of the sender, and using a different communications channel such as a quick phone call to confirm authenticity of the sender and email contents 2FA is another important way to prevent a spear-phishing attack from leading to an account compromise‚Äîjust having your username and password will not be enough to access your account. As part of the campaign‚Äôs strong security culture, senior staff should recognize and praise anyone who reports suspicious behavior on their system or admits to clicking a potentially malicious link.', 'Phishing can happen on the phone, too!\xa0 Staff should never share information, wire money, or give anything else away on the phone if they aren‚Äôt certain who the caller is.\xa0 Make staff aware of the threat and tell train them to listen to how the caller greets them and to ask questions that outsiders may not be able to answer.\xa0 You can easily test your staff on phishing calls‚Äîand your friends will enjoy doing it!', '""THINK BEFORE YOU CLICK""', 'PAUSE before you click on a link within an email to check what address the email is coming from and to ask yourself if the email is suspicious.', 'CONFIRM that a request for information, money, personal information, passwords, documents, etc. is legitimate by following up with the person requesting, ideally in person, or at least by phone.\xa0 Never give your password or personal information over a link.', 'REPORT anything suspicious to your leadership by forwarding any email that‚Äôs remotely questionable. Make sure you flag it as ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù (e.g., in the title) so that no one else inadvertently acts on a malicious email.', '', '', 'ENHANCED: Take the Next Step', 'WORKING WITH SECURITY PROFESSIONALS', 'If you decide to work with a security professional, how will you evaluate the right person or firm? Whether it‚Äôs through personal recommendations or positive public reviews, it‚Äôs important that you avoid costly yet ineffective support. When interviewing potential security professionals, ask about how they‚Äôve responded to past security incidents and how they‚Äôve enabled others to work more securely. Your respective national party committee or trusted campaign professionals may be able to recommend options to choose from. Bear in mind that culture affects security and that even the best recommendations may fail to achieve results if they are not followed\xa0 (i.e., just hiring a firm won‚Äôt solve your problems).', '\xa0', '', '\xa0', 'Not all methods of communication are equally secure, so use the most secure method possible. Campaign leadership should set a standard that encourages in-person conversations whenever possible, and discourages needless or superfluous emails. Whether it is phone calls, texting, or emailing, different products and services offer different levels of protection, so do your research before you choose which systems your campaign is going to use.', 'GOOD: What You Need to Do', 'WHAT IS THE CLOUD?', '‚ÄúCloud services‚Äù provide management and access to information stored remotely on the Internet. They run on off-site servers managed by third-party companies; this includes many common services you may already use, such as Gmail or Dropbox. It‚Äôs good to store information in the cloud instead of on your personal computer because reputable cloud service providers have the money and expertise to make their server farms more secure than your laptop‚Äôs hard drive, or an office server. It‚Äôs like the difference between leaving\xa0 cash under your mattress and storing it in a bank‚Äôs security vault. Using reputable cloud services offers an additional backstop against data loss if an individual device is lost or compromised. Cloud storage is a feature included in comprehensive office security services such as GSuite and Microsoft365. Other services include Dropbox or Box.', '\xa0', 'WHAT IS ENCRYPTION?', 'Encryption is a way of encoding information when it travels between users, or when it‚Äôs stored, so it can‚Äôt be read by anyone but the intended recipient. Think of it this way: a user ‚Äúscrambles‚Äù the data when she sends it and only the intended recipient has the key to unscramble it. Using encryption is smart, especially for sensitive information, because even if an adversary steals the data, it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll be able to read it. Most apps that use encryption, like Signal or Wickr, make the process seamless. Laptops or cloud storage systems use encryption as well.', '\xa0', '', '\xa0', 'One of the most challenging aspects of security is keeping unauthorized people out. This means preventing adversaries from gaining access to your data and preventing people within your campaign from having access to information they do not need. While some of the recommendations below may seem cumbersome, hackers depend on those who value convenience over security.', 'WHAT IS TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION?', 'Two-factor authentication is a second layer of security that requires a user to provide an extra credential beyond her or his password. The second factor is critical because, if your password is stolen, an adversary still can‚Äôt log into your account. Your password is something you know and your second factor is something you have, like a code that‚Äôs generated by an app, a physical key, or even something biometric, like a fingerprint.', '\xa0', 'GOOD: What You Need to Do', 'PASSWORD MANAGERS', 'Password managers are a way to store, retrieve, and generate passwords. Some even have the ability to auto-populate the password line on login pages. The password manager requires a password of its own to login, which becomes the one password you do have to remember. The risk, of course, is that if someone breaks into your password manager (it has happened), that person will have all of your passwords. But this risk is almost always far outweighed by the benefit of strong, unique passwords across all of your accounts. For campaigns, password managers sometimes make sense for accounts that have multiple users, because the administrator can safely share access to them.', '\xa0', 'ENHANCED: Take the Next Step', 'ADMINISTRATORS', 'In ‚ÄúIT speak,‚Äù an ‚Äúadministrator‚Äù or ‚Äúadmin‚Äù has the ability to give people access or control to systems or information. For example, as the ‚Äúadmin‚Äù for an email system, you can create accounts, change passwords, and set requirements like password length and two-factor authentication for all accounts. In an office suite like GSuite or Microsoft 365, you can also create groups, such as\xa0 the ‚ÄúField Team‚Äù or ‚ÄúComms Team.‚Äù An admin‚Äôs job is really important. If they do things right, information will be available only to people who need it, which is essential for security. This means that deciding who gets admin privileges is also a critical decision. Only a few, highly trusted people should be able to grant others access to information. If a staffer with ‚Äúadmin‚Äù privileges leaves the campaign, make sure to take away their privileges immediately!', '', '\xa0', 'Every physical device in your campaign‚Äîfrom a cell phone, tablet, or laptop to a router, printer, or camera‚Äîrepresents a potential attack path into your network. A good cybersecurity plan will attempt to control access to, into, and on all devices. You can control access to devices by making sure they are always properly handled and accounted for. You control access into devices via two-factor authentication and strong passwords. You control the content on devices via encryption and the policies guiding how you store data (i.e., storing information in the cloud instead of on machines).', 'GOOD: What You Need to Do', 'WHAT IS ENDPOINT PROTECTION?', 'Endpoints are the devices that staff use, including mobile phones, laptop computers, and desktop computers. They are the ‚Äúendpoints‚Äù of the campaign‚Äôs network, and staff are the ‚Äúend users.‚Äù Endpoint protection centrally controls and manages security on remote devices. It‚Äôs especially important for campaigns that allow staff to ‚Äúbring your own device‚Äù (BYOD), since the campaign needs to ensure that the device is secure, free of malware, and can be wiped if stolen or lost. Endpoint protection can also monitor the device to make sure software is up to date and detect new malware or potential threats. For many campaigns, this will feel like a big lift, but building it into your routine onboarding and investing some time upfront can save you a lot of grief later.', '\xa0', 'ENHANCED: Take the Next Step', '', '\xa0', 'Networks are the system of physical hardware, digital software, and their connections.

Some offices use it as a way to log remotely into the office network, but this isn‚Äôt very common for campaigns.

Some victims of cyber crimes have previously made grandiose pronouncements about their own security measures, or have criticized others who have been attacked. The press will hold you accountable for what you said in the past if you fall victim.', '‚úî Similarly, avoid providing details about the scope of the event in the early phases of the incident (and if you can avoid discussing the scope altogether, even better). Details available at the outset will change as you investigate. A common mistake is to say something that later turns out not to be true (e.g., ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt steal very much,‚Äù or ‚Äúno personal information was taken‚Äù). Saying only what you know for sure is the safest course. Statements should focus on the actions you are taking to make the situation right for the affected stakeholders.', '‚úî Develop some boilerplate language iin advance, so that you can draft statements or talking points quickly if an incident occurs. At a minimum, create a simple Q & A document that you can rapidly revise if you actually need to use it. Creating a Q & A document in advance will help you to think as much about what you won‚Äôt say as what you will say. For example, the first question will often be, ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù However, you may not be able to answer that for days or weeks. The fact that you don‚Äôt know what kind of breach will take place can actually help you write better boilerplate answers in advance.', '‚úî Stay in touch with your key stakeholders and keep them as informed as you can. You probably won‚Äôt be able to say much, but contacting them regularly with what you do know, having a clear statement about your intentions, and providing details about what you are doing to manage the situation are key.

False rumors and misinformation spread on platforms have led to mob violence and put elections under scrutiny. Conspiracy theories spread online  endanger everyone, leading to radicalization and mass violence.', 'Companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google are entirely responsible for deciding what can or cannot stay up. AI-based algorithms speed up the process, but how are the rules decided? Human moderators can be hired, but at what cost to their mental health?', 'The internet has connected our world more connected than ever before, but we now risk losing it to the tragedy of the ‚Äúdigital commons‚Äù.', 'We are researchers building a new system to make decisions around how content moderation rules are formed. Like doing jury duty, you will join a panel of ‚Äúnetizens‚Äù in deciding the hard questions on how content moderation rules should be formed using real cases.', 'Sorry, we are not taking participants right now.', 'As concerns have grown regarding harmful content spread on social media, platform mechanisms for content moderation have become increasingly significant. However, many existing platform governance structures lack formal processes for democratic participation by users of the platform. Drawing inspiration from constitutional jury trials in many legal systems, this paper proposes digital juries as a civics-oriented approach for adjudicating content moderation cases. Building on existing theoretical models of jury decision-making, we outline a 5-stage model characterizing the space of design considerations in a digital jury process. We implement two examples of jury designs involving blind-voting and deliberation. From users who participate in our jury implementations, we gather informed judgments of the democratic legitimacy of a jury process for content moderation. We find that digital juries are perceived as more procedurally just than existing common platform moderation practices, but also find disagreement over whether jury decisions should be enforced or used as recommendations.', 'Download the full paper (PDF)', 'The video recording of the presentation is below, as presented remotely during the CambridgeCHI presentations on May 14, 2020.']","['https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwk9zd/how-facebook-content-moderation-works', 'http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/07/11/online-harassment-2017/', 'https://ies.berkeley.edu/fake-news-and-crisis-europe', 'https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2018/inside-whatsapps-battle-against-misinformation-in-india/', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/05/23/russian-election-interference-europe-s-counter-to-fake-news-and-cyber-attacks-pub-76435', 'https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18029490/cesar-sayoc-mail-bombs-twitter-instagram-misinformation', 'https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwippZqZpIjhAhWlT98KHTbPBkQQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fpost-nation%2Fwp%2F2016%2F08%2F22%2Fprosecutors-say-accused-charleston-church-gunman-self-radicalized-online%2F&usg=AOvVaw2jUsPsqkZ9ikWkyTjZvmiX', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/technology/facebook-youtube-christchurch-shooting.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/world/facebook-moderators.html', 'https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-blueprint-for-content-governance-and-enforcement/10156443129621634/', 'https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona', 'https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/the-tragedy-of-the-digital-commons/395129/', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376293', 'https://chi2020.acm.org/', 'https://youtu.be/QaRiYFhOKZQ?t=9544']","{'pewinternet.org', 'berkeley.edu', 'theverge.com', 'poynter.org', 'facebook.com', 'theatlantic.com', 'google.com', 'carnegieendowment.org', 'youtu.be', 'nytimes.com', 'acm.org', 'vice.com'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

64,https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2017/01/27/discovery-into-consultations/,200,Discovery into consultations - Inside GOV.UK,"['https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2017/01/27/discovery-into-consultations/', 'One of the aims for the GOV.UK roadmap this year was to understand more about how digital tools could improve consultations. In Q3 of this year we hired The Democratic Society and Snook to carry out a 6 week discovery. This work was also part of our commitment to the Open Government National Action Plan.', 'GOV.UK is currently home to 3,600 consultations with more being added everyday. We have already done a lot to make consultations easier to find and more consistent. We brought all government consultations into one place for the first time, with filters to view them by their state, published date, subject matter and by which organisation published them. Users can subscribe to be notified by email when consultations are added, based on their interests.', 'There is a dedicated format for consultations, with custom-built features which reflect the lifecycle of a consultation as it moves from being open, to closed, to conclusion. GOV.UK also supports the use of varied tools government organisations can choose to build or buy, to host discussion or collect feedback online, by linking out to separate platforms (like Delib‚Äôs CitizenSpace for example).', ""But we haven't iterated consultations on GOV.UK much since it was first built. In the meantime, the practice of consultation has moved on, with more options available. The consultation principles were updated, leading us to ask whether the current tool on GOV.UK was consistent with the updated principles."", 'We needed to look into it again, and find out what the opportunities might be to improve the effectiveness of government consultations - both for respondents and policy teams - through digital tools.', 'Over 60 people were interviewed to help understand the user needs of digital consultations. This included a range of users from government departments, non-departmental public bodies, expert respondents and the general public. By speaking to different user groups, it was possible to map the full end to end experience for a consultation from the viewpoint of both creators and the people who respond to them. It‚Äôs clear that there‚Äôs a wide range of user needs with no single best practice for consultations.', 'There are no fixed requirements for how to carry out a consultation, and government approaches them in a variety of ways. The most common approach is a simple question and answer format. While this is the common way of doing it, this format doesn‚Äôt work as a one-size-fits-all solution for all consultations. The survey-based method of consultation only allows for a single type of interaction to take place, namely for a respondent to reply to predefined questions, and for that interaction to take place in a single direction, from the user to the person who created it.', 'The discovery did some desk research to look into alternative ways of carrying out consultations around the world. Many governments choose to use third party tools to add value to consultations. The Scottish government published responses with names attached to increase transparency in who was responding. The Department for Health helped engage respondents with videos and tailored information for each consultation. The government of Ontario focused on the analytics of consultations by publishing the demographic of respondents in easy to read visuals. We even saw the New Zealand government engage respondents using Loomio and Github for feedback and discussions.', 'The most significant trend in the digital consultation landscape is the broad uptake of a variety of different tools that enable options of interactions beyond a simple series of questions and answers.', 'The discovery gave us pointers to focus on for the future. Some small changes could be made to improve the current GOV.UK consultations page. For example, we could add extra headings to the page template, and reorder it to make it easier to read and understand.', ""More broadly, departments should continue to use the expertise currently available from third party developers. It is clear that there is no evidence for GDS to build a standalone consultations platform, instead given the range of tools already out there, departments are able to choose one which best fits their needs. Following an approach that supports the innovation already in this sector will allow for new and emerging consultation tools to be incorporated quickly into government practice.\xa0We'll be writing up some guidance on using third-party tools to host your consultations to clarify how you can do it."", 'If you would like to know more about consultations current practice please contact govuk-enquiries@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk', 'Charles is a policy and engagement manager on GOV.UK.', 'Sign up for email updates\xa0so you never miss a post.', '\nComment by\nJohn Ploughman\nposted on\non 27 January 2017\n', 'Thanks for the update, Charles.', 'Is there any news on when it will be possible to publish a consultation response as an HTML document? ', ""At the moment it's only possible to publish the consultation document itself in HTML. Any government responses to the consultation have to either be published as either a PDF or other downloadable document."", 'Some of our consultations are now getting around a 60 to 70% mobile and tablet user base, so publishing a PDF is less than ideal.', 'Thanks\nJohn', '\nComment by\nCharles Davie\nposted on\non 07 February 2017\n', 'Hi John,', ""It's great to see such a high engagement via mobile and tablet for consultations. I think this mirrors the wide user needs of consultations in the blog post."", ""We're going to look into this.

We want to help people navigate GOV.UK as quickly and easily as possible, and ensure we can proactively support their needs, without them needing to understand the structures of government or explicitly know what service they are looking for.', 'Today, I can share more information about what this work looks like in practice.', 'GOV.UK is built on the principle that you shouldn‚Äôt need to know how the government works to use government services. We do the hard work to make things simple for users. That means we make interactions with the government easy, effective and accessible, for example by using language that‚Äôs familiar to our users instead of complicated legal terms.', 'The progress we‚Äôve made means that GOV.UK now generally works well if you know what you need to do and if it is a discrete task or transaction.', 'Now we need to do the next major iteration in how we provide public services online. We‚Äôll do that by attending to complex interactions that happen over time and across several services - like understanding the end of the Brexit Transition period, or starting and sustaining a business.', 'The way people interact online has changed a lot over the 8 years since GOV.UK launched. Services like shopping, banking or entertainment are increasingly personalised. These services typically combine some data about the user with data about their ‚Äòthing‚Äô. As a result, they can provide an experience that is tailored and relevant.', 'So users now expect services that can be all of the following:', 'At GOV.UK we want to keep up with users expectations and make the most of changes in technology to provide the best possible public services. This matters because it is efficient for government, and efficient for the user - getting the right things to the right people at the right time.', 'We‚Äôd like to simplify journeys to:\xa0', 'And we need to do all this while making sure users understand how their data is being used, so they can consent (or not) to those arrangements.', 'To provide this kind of interaction and experience, we need an account infrastructure for GOV.UK. This idea isn‚Äôt new. There are already lots of government accounts for specific services - we‚Äôve recorded over a 100 places that a user could login already, and that trend will only continue.', 'We want to unify this experience - not to create an ‚Äòuber CRM‚Äô for the government - but to give users continuity, so that they don‚Äôt need to start from scratch each time they need to do something with the government.', 'A centralised GOV.UK account will be new to people, and there are valid concerns about data use and privacy. We‚Äôre working to get a better understanding of how users feel about the government providing a service in this way. With early prototypes we have found that most people assume that data about them is already held centrally in government and that accounts are - or should be - linked.\n', 'You might ask whether people really interact with GOV.UK enough to warrant this kind of investment. We‚Äôre validating our figures further on this, but we believe that current interaction with GOV.UK is equivalent to everyone in the UK visiting at least 22 times per year - nearly twice per month. A number that is only going to grow as digital interactions with government increase.', 'This is about using data to make services more efficient, delivering policy to users quicker, radically improving support over time, and being able to communicate directly to users. It is about keeping pace with how people expect to receive service.', 'This vision is ambitious and, like everything we build on GOV.UK, we want to develop it iteratively so that we can learn about what works for users as we scale up. Before we start linking to lots of transactions, we want to learn about how users choose to interact with an account, and what works and what doesn‚Äôt.', 'We‚Äôre planning a series of experiments now. These will give us the opportunity to test different functionality and understand how users interact with the government. They will also give us the chance to test some questions we‚Äôve been considering. Questions like:', ""GOV.UK is the trusted source for government information and services, and we take maintaining our users' trust very seriously. We recognise that a big part of maintaining that trust comes down to the way we approach data privacy and security. Consequently, we are taking a privacy and security by design approach. This enables us to identify potential privacy and security problems early on and to build the GOV.UK account in a way that protects our users' data and privacy. This includes using robust security technologies, giving users control of their data and being transparent about how a GOV.UK account uses data."", 'It‚Äôs also important to make sure we do not exclude users who don‚Äôt want to (or can‚Äôt), for whatever reason, use an account. Information on GOV.UK will never be locked behind a login.', 'I am hugely excited for this next phase in the GOV.UK journey, and the benefits that accounts will bring for users. Of course, we have a Comprehensive Spending Review ahead, and this work has many dependencies if it is to be successful. I look forward to writing again with further updates and insights as we progress this exciting project.', 'If you have any feedback or questions, you can leave a comment or email us on govuk-enquiries@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.', 'You may also be interested in:', '\nComment by\nMarios Patrinos\nposted on\non 13 November 2020\n', ""I think this is a fantastic idea in principle and builds on the slow and steady progress that individual digital public services have been making.\nFundamentally, The Government knows who we are from the day we are born. Interactions with public services are a mainstay of everyday life be it taxing a car, registering a death, getting a passport or drawing your pension.\nThroughout a citizen's life, here will be an ebb and flow to these interactions.\nAs part of this work, therefore, it will be vital that the Account service can evolve with the users needs over time. For example, ensuring that as citizens get older or life changing events occur, they may require particular attention or approaches to ensure the Account still works for them.\nOf course, as is evidenced by the great work already shown on this site, I know accessibility and inclusion are forefront in your minds. I would urge however, for it to be as much part of the design as security is.\nRather than catching up, ALL users need to be brought along on the same journey as being on a different timetable in of itself, sets them apart."", '\nComment by\nEmma-Jane Stogdon\nposted on\non 29 September 2020\n', ""Unifying access is certainly a good idea, I myself have had issues in the past after having to re-input the same information over and over, so it's a really good way to avoid human error."", 'It also lessens the cross-departmental disparities that can sometimes arise and ensure details are up-to-date and current across them all.

I know it's early stages yet but it feels like there's still a lot of unanswered questions. I'm still a bit unsure about whether a personalised service is actually a user need. Surely the need is the user getting the right information or service that they need, and personalisation is one solution to solving that need, rather than a need in itself?"", 'I would also like to understand more about what you mean on the convenience side of it. I wonder if you could expand upon the ""don‚Äôt need to start from scratch each time they need to do something with the government"" need. Are these accounts going to include authentication and if so is not going to run into the same problems as Verify? If not, how is it going to make interactions with government more convenient? If it\'s just about linking data that different bits of government hold on individuals together then I\'m unclear about how accounts necessarily solve that issue?', 'I would also be curious to know where the ""current interaction with GOV.UK is equivalent to everyone in the UK visiting at least 22 times per year"" statistic comes from? If it\'s correct, it\'s quite an incredible statistic and a testament to how useful and ubiquitous GOV.UK has become!', ""It's really great to see this thinking and work being done in the open and I hope that there will be lots of opportunities for the public and people across government to contribute to this."", '\nComment by\nThe GDS Team\nposted on\non 25 September 2020\n', 'Hi Thomas,', 'Thanks for your questions! We‚Äôre keen to share our thinking early and often - so have provided some initial responses here, but do look out for further posts on this topic.', 'To start with your first question about ‚Äòpersonalisation‚Äô: this is a bit of a catch-all phrase to cover improvements to the overall user experience; making it quicker, easier, and more intuitive for them to do the things that they need to do. By helping users receive a more personally relevant (or tailored) interaction with the government, in a controllable way for them, we can improve the overall experience of user interactions with government. This also means that we can reduce failure demand, but helping people do the things they need to do right from the start. We know from user research that people increasingly expect this type of experience based on ‚Äòpersonalised‚Äô interactions they have with other digital products like banking, grocery shopping, or planning a holiday.', 'By and large, GOV.UK works well now if you know what you need to look for, and that ‚Äòthing‚Äô is a discrete task and you search for it - like applying for Universal Credit. But we also know that, often, the interactions people or businesses need to have with government are made up of lots of ‚Äòthings‚Äô over time, across multiple services, or are ‚Äòunknown‚Äô to the user (you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know!). We can also see that users are providing the same information over and over again across different services, and they have no way of managing that efficiently. We want to address these types of use cases. You are right that there has been significant amounts of learning about things like authentication and verification systems in the government and both, we anticipate, will have a role in this future system. We will continue to share regularly on how this work is developing.', 'Regarding 22 interactions with GOV.UK a year, we agree with you on this one! We‚Äôve calculated this number based on a few different statistics. In the year before we shifted to ‚Äòopt-in‚Äô cookie consent (i.e. when we captured full analytics), GOV.UK was accessed by 435 million unique devices (mobile, laptop etc), and each of those devices accessed the site (e.g. for information or services) an average of 3.41 times a year. If we extrapolate this onto the UK population (c.67 million), we can therefore say that average visits for an individual in the UK is c. 22 times per year, as individuals will use multiple devices. There are a couple caveats that apply to this number including unprecedented levels of traffic over the past year, not including visits from outside the UK, and not being able to pick up on information accessed directly from search or through voice assistants.', 'We are committed to working in the open. Yes, there are, and will continue to be, many ways for the public and people in the government to contribute.', 'Thanks,\nThe GDS Team', '\nComment by\nAlex Wolff (Softwire)\nposted on\non 23 September 2020\n', 'That looks really interesting - thanks for sharing the thinking.

', 'Some of the useful information you might glean from the social network for professionals include: ', 'It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that all of the information listed on a profile is self-reported and can be completely made up (for example, no, David Jewberg is not the name of a senior Pentagon Russia analyst).', 'Before beginning an investigation, there are a few steps you should take so that you can access as much content as possible and ensure your anonymity. ', 'First, create a profile. If you don‚Äôt, you won‚Äôt be able to view profiles whose public visibility setting is turned off. It‚Äôs against LinkedIn‚Äôs terms of service to create a fake profile or more than one profile for yourself, but doing so allows you to obscure your true identity from the subjects of your research.\xa0', 'Second, make sure your profile‚Äôs privacy settings are as strict as possible so that you don‚Äôt reveal your identity (this is obviously more important if you are conducting research under your real LinkedIn account). Click on the ‚ÄúMe‚Äù icon in the top-right corner of the page, and go to ‚ÄúSettings & Privacy‚Äù under ‚ÄúACCOUNT.‚Äù There are dozens of settings to lock down, so I won‚Äôt go through all of them, but probably the most important setting to change is under ‚Äúprofile viewing options.‚Äù ', 'Here, you can change what LinkedIn users see about you when you view their profile. Instead of your real name and headline (or that of your alias profile), you can choose to be in private mode so that you appear as an ‚ÄúAnonymous LinkedIn Member.‚Äù', 'LinkedIn Premium users can see who has viewed their profiles going back 90 days, but they cannot see users who are in private mode. You will know someone has a Premium account when you see this gold LinkedIn logo:', '', 'Non-Premium LinkedIn users who are not in private mode can also see a few details about some of the most recent individuals who have viewed their profile:', '', 'So, if your company affiliation will alert your target to the fact that they‚Äôre being investigated, you can either use a fake profile or change your current employer to one other than your own.', 'Please also note that non-premium users who are in private mode cannot see any users who have viewed their profile.', 'The easiest way to find a LinkedIn profile for someone with an uncommon name is to Google their name with the word ‚ÄúLinkedIn‚Äù in quotes. If that doesn‚Äôt work, also include something you know about them, such as their location or current employer. More often than not, Google‚Äôs search algorithms will surface the relevant profile. There are also people search sites like Pipl and Spokeo that return LinkedIn profiles if you can identify the relevant individual.', 'In cases where the subject has a common name or you are otherwise having a difficult time locating their profile, here are some techniques to try.', 'By default, LinkedIn allows ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù to look up your profile via email. \xa0You can change the setting to ‚Äú2nd-degree connections‚Äù and ‚Äúnobody.‚Äù', 'If you have an email address for your target, enter it into this URL in place of example@example.com (you have to be logged in to LinkedIn): ', 'https://www.linkedin.com/sales/gmail/profile/viewByEmail/example@example.com', 'If the subject used that email address for their profile and their privacy settings are set to ‚Äúeveryone,‚Äù you will see something like this:', '', 'To go to the subject‚Äôs LinkedIn profile, click either their name or the LinkedIn logo.', 'In the above example, I used the Gmail address of Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht: ', 'https://www.linkedin.com/sales/gmail/profile/viewByEmail/rossulbricht@gmail.com.

This is what it looks like when you have more luck:', '', 'Clicking the Google+ and Facebook icons lead to Ulbricht‚Äôs accounts on those platforms.', 'It‚Äôs important to make note of whether there is a username in the URL of a LinkedIn profile. The default URL provided by LinkedIn is typically separated by dashes and has seemingly random letters and numbers at the end (e.g., https://www.linkedin.com/in/jammiro-quatro-1a410656). LinkedIn lets users customize their URL into a unique username (e.g., https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossulbricht), which can then be Googled or run through a service like KnowEm, which will search for the username on hundreds of websites.

', 'If your subject has included a profile photo, run it through reverse image search services, including TinEye and Yandex. As shown again and again, Yandex is far superior to Google when it comes to reverse image searches and facial recognition, even when filters are used.', 'If you‚Äôre still unable to identify useful information to pivot on, take a look at the subject‚Äôs endorsers. Find a few endorsers with uncommon names and try quickly searching for their Facebook profiles, for instance, to see if any of them have public friends lists. If you find an endorser with a public Facebook friends list, search for your subject there (try just their first name or just their last name, as it‚Äôs not uncommon for Facebook users to use a middle name or some other slight name variation instead of their full name). ', 'If you‚Äôve identified multiple LinkedIn profiles of interest, and you‚Äôre interested in determining connections between or among them, there‚Äôs a useful command line script called The Endorser that will visualize common endorsers of two or more LinkedIn profiles. \xa0The output is a PDF that like this:', '', 'In some cases, you may want to know with a little more specificity where a LinkedIn user indicates that they live, especially for users who list their location as ‚Äú[Large City] Area.‚Äù For example, say your subject lists their location as the Washington, D.C.

112,https://medium.com/@abscond/membership-a-prototype-ea822b2683b,200,Membership: a prototype. I‚Äôve been increasingly tweeting about‚Ä¶ | by James Darling | Medium,"['Sign in', 'James Darling', 'Feb 26, 2017¬∑8 min read', 'I‚Äôve been increasingly tweeting about the ‚Äútransformation‚Äù of our civic institutions necessary for them to survive in the 21st century, but what that really means is a bit hard to explain. I want to talk about a prototype I built over a weekend last October when trying to figure it out in my own head, in the hope that it helps.', 'I built it with the Labour Party in mind. I had recently left working on the digital transformation project and, almost as a bit of therapy for myself, I wanted to release a load of things in my head into some code. But in doing so, I think it touches on some of the challenges that any organisation that wants to be member led and/or heavily relies on volunteers, which makes up a large percentage of our civic institutions.', 'This is going to be an oversimplification, but we‚Äôre dealing in abstracts, so forgive me. The majority of successful digital products in existence today are built on two possible organisational models: atomised individuals interacting with each other, or a centralised organisation (typically a company) interacting with its users (typically customers).', 'There are probably many reasons for this, economic and political, but this is where we are. Any organisations that want to use these tools are forced into choosing between something like Whatsapp, which quickly allows atomised individuals to communicate with each other, or a traditional CRM which encourages the organisation into a more staff/customer model.', 'You can see this forced dichotomy playing out in the language of this sector; you have ‚Äòtraditional organisations‚Äô trying (and mostly failing) to engage with the ‚Äògrassroots‚Äô. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, but neither are particularly effective in 2017.', 'Traditional organisations are pulled into creating bureaucracies that are better suited to a corporate company of the 1990s. ‚ÄòVolunteers‚Äô suddenly have to behave more like staff members, while new members who are unable or not yet willing to make such commitments begin to see the organisation as a professionalised company to be a customer of, rather than an active member.', 'Meanwhile, grassroots organisations struggle to create any useful bureaucracies at all, rapidly collapsing under their own weight if they try to expand or build power. They are too risky for power to engage with seriously. Without simple, public ways for new members to get involved, they often end up cliquey.', 'I feel there is the possibility to build new bureaucracies, largely written in open source code instead of rulebooks (because it‚Äôs 2017), that break down this dichotomy, and allow smaller grass roots teams to help and be helped by the more centralised and professionalised HQ. This prototype was a stab at that.', 'Managing the personal data of members is just one example, but a powerful one. For one, most member based organisations just don‚Äôt know how to deal with this currently, trying to balance data protection laws, user experience and organisational flexibility. Unsuccessfully. They‚Äôre unsure who should be able to have access to what information, and how to give it to them, resulting in messy fudges, like excel spreadsheets being handed around to everyone, and leaders sending messages using their personal accounts.', 'It is also perhaps one of the core bits of infrastructure for a membership run organisation, the better this bit works, the easier it is to build on top of.', 'If you ignore all of the above writing, then put simply, this prototype is a CRM. Except it‚Äôs not, because we don‚Äôt have customers, we have members, so let‚Äôs call it an MRM. But by building it, I think we‚Äôre creating a founding block for organisations that simply aren‚Äôt possible currently, but are desperately needed.', 'The source code is on github, and I have an instance running on a free heroku plan, but I‚Äôll provide screenshots and a walkthrough here.', 'At it‚Äôs core, it‚Äôs a membership database. I have seeded it here with 10,000 fake profiles, but I also wrote an import script to be able to grab real data out of a nationbuilder account.', 'Already, a canonical list of members held in a database with open source code is a great leap forward for many membership organisations, but we need to make it usable.', 'The most common task I‚Äôve seen is being filtering and searching the members by various categories, and in this example I have created filters for membership status, date of birth, and physical address by drawing on a map. So if I want to be able to find all under-30s who live within the M25, I can do so like above.', 'A quick side note on why drawing on a map. Standardised geographic boundaries are complicated, not very user friendly, and often the data is not available. There has been some great work like MySociety‚Äôs MapIt to help developers access some of this data, and Democracy Club are campaigning to free more of it, but even then it‚Äôs a bit archaic and not all organisations necessarily map to these boundaries. So while we may use this data to seed these drawings, to avoid these problems and enable greater flexibility, nothing beats just drawing on a map.', 'So far so useful and many existing tools, to varying degrees of success, allow this to happen. But then how do you share this data? In practice, this is often exported as a spreadsheet and sent to an organiser of this group, to use in whatever tools they feel most comfortable with.', 'I want to cover two problems with this, the first and more obviously scary one is data protection. Personal data is now being handed around with very little oversight or guidance from the central organisation on how to use this data, leading to confusion around what is legal and what is not. This can be reduced by creating rules and procedures (again, it‚Äôs 2017) on who can access the data, and professionalising those people, but this starts creating brittle bureaucracy pushing us back into a more staff/customer relationship', 'But in my view, the even more fundamental problem is the member experience of this. We can not expect all members, especially new members, to fully understand the bureaucratic structures of the organisation they are a member of, but we needn‚Äôt make it more confusing than it needs to be. Being emailed from a personal email address by a person you have never heard of, representing a group that you don‚Äôt understand is confusing.', 'In every contact, the member should be able to have at least a basic understanding of who this person is, and how they fit into the larger picture of the organisation. They should be able to easily request to be more or less involved with this group.', 'As an example of this from Labour, when I was volunteering on the first Jeremy Corbyn leadership campaign, we had a moderately sized list of members who, by diligently following Labour Party policy, we were unable to contact to thank them for their donations because they had unsubscribed from Labour communications by entirely different groups about campaigns they didn‚Äôt know where happening. Another example being that when a member leaves a group, eg by moving house into another constituency, an increasingly common occurance, it can take a while, it it happens at all, for your personal data to be removed from that group‚Äôs silo‚Äôd member list.', 'We can create tools that make all this easier if we start thinking about realistic semantics of these groups, and being able to represent this in databases and open source code. In my prototype, you can take any filter of members, and create a ‚Äògroup‚Äô out of it. A group has many members (this is beginning to sound a bit like a first year computer science degree example), and we can programmatically and manually keep that list up to date. We can share that information with both the member, so they have knowledge of who has their information and why, and with an organiser, so that they can contact them with minimal bureaucracy.', 'Here we have created a new logged in user, Greg, and he has been given privileges to the group we have just created. Note that he can only see the personal data of the members of his group, but he still has all the same tools as an admin. If he had appropriate privileges over multiple groups, all relevant members would be available.', 'This information can be kept up to date by Greg, HQ, the user or an API, we can share with the member that Greg has access to their data and why he has it, and his privileges can be removed when necessary.', 'If we were following a good micro-application architecture, we might have a separate open source application to allow Greg to actually email members which gets the relevant data from this application via an API, but as this is a prototype and that‚Äôs probably a bit too nerdy to get into right now.', 'So I have quickly thrown in a minimal email client that uses Mailgun for delivery. This shows one functionally useful feature than can be built on such a structure. Emails sent from here can provide some clear explanation to members why they have received this email. The unsubscribe link can show the member all the groups they are a member of, providing some in context learning and navigation, while giving them more nuanced control over their involvement in the organisation as a whole.', 'This is just a prototype, written alone over a weekend, and we probably shouldn‚Äôt be listening to yet another white man theorising alone in their house. I‚Äôm genuinely not sure what the next steps should be. I‚Äôm not sure if any existing large and established civic institutions are capable and willing to start genuinely exploring this stuff, and my own new charity is years aways from needing this sort of infrastructure.', 'But I‚Äôm hoping it shows some potential. By getting some of this core infrastructure right, we can build brilliant things on top of it and around it. For example, I think by getting it right, it unlocks the ability to build online democratic processes and tools to increase engagement of volunteers and the effectiveness of their engagement.', 'Entirely new things are also possible, like OAuth servers that allow members of one organisation to verify themselves to and share data with affiliated member organisations. But we‚Äôre getting ahead of ourselves.', 'I also hope, by writing this, that I begin to show the political power of organisational bureaucracy, and provide a practical example of how we need to be able to tweak the very core of our civic institutions to enable them to survive and flourish in the digital age. The importance of flourishing civic institutions hasn‚Äôt been as urgently apparent as it is now since the industrial revolution.', 'Code, Digital Transformation & Politics.

125,https://ntouk.wordpress.com/2020/06/28/online-public-services-in-the-uk-23-years-of-federated-identity/,200,Online Public Services in the UK ‚Äî 23 years of federated identity ‚Äì new tech observations from the UK (ntouk),"['new tech observations from the UK (ntouk)', ""Jerry Fishenden's technology blog"", 'Here‚Äôs my paper providing an overview of Federated Identity for Access to UK Public Services: 1997-2020 (PDF):', 'As its catchy title suggests, it provides an historic overview of the\xa0UK Government‚Äôs approach to\xa0federated identity over the past 23 years, segmenting the journey into three stages:', 'It isn‚Äôt intended to be history for its own sake‚Äîit aims to improve situational awareness and hence narrow the gaps between long-standing policy aspiration and technical implementation. I think there‚Äôs an opportunity to make significant progress in the coming year or so, but only if we learn and apply the many lessons of what has often proved a somewhat circular and repetitive odyssey. Consider this for example‚Äîit‚Äôs from the Cabinet Office in 1996, a year before the UK Government started experimenting with trusted third parties:', 'Some transactions with government (e.g. to claim a benefit) require proof of financial circumstances. This might be provided by one or more financial institutions such as a bank or a building society. Clearly, such institutions cannot send information about their customers to government on a regular basis. However, an arrangement might be put in place whereby a customer could authorise government\xa0‚Ä¶\xa0to request specific data from financial institutions. Arrangements would have to be put in place between government and financial institutions, to enable such authenticated requests to be forwarded and responses supplied to government.', 'That was written twenty-four years ago. Twenty-four years. And yet it sounds remarkably similar to what could now be achieved with an appropriate agreement between say users, Open Banking and public sector service providers. After all, the value of verified attributes was recognised long ago as being at least as important as ‚Äúidentity‚Äù‚Äîthe government‚Äôs original 1999 authentication framework has numerous references to attributes, including the need to ensure:', '‚Ä¶ that the attributes associated with the identity are consistent, accurate and recorded in standard form.', 'Possible measures to ensure that attributes submitted ‚Ä¶ are accurate include ‚Ä¶ requiring that a trustworthy person or organisation confirm the information given.', 'Maybe its time to reset and radically simplify the technical approach‚Äîwhilst ensuring trust through effective privacy and security‚Äîto reflect this pragmatic policy of 2000:', '‚Äì work with a range of trusted service providers, to ensure interoperability with government processes', '‚Äì identify where the marketplace is adopting suitable technologies for secure transactions and access, and ensure that the Government makes full use of these to meet electronic service delivery targets', 'All a bit ‚Äúback to the future‚Äù perhaps, but worth reconsidering the second point above in particular given the rich variety of identity-related initiatives available that government could now tap into. Anyhow, read the paper and see what you think. ', 'Since publication of my paper, I‚Äôve had comments and feedback, documented below. In any future updates to the paper‚Äîmost likely to happen once the post GOV.UK Verify landscape becomes clearer‚Äî I will address these issues where appropriate. I am very grateful to those who have found time to read and comment upon the paper.', 'General: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs confusing having numeric superscript for both footnotes and references‚Äù. In any update, I will use alphabetical superscript for footnotes to distinguish them more clearly from numerical references.', 'p.10. ‚ÄúIdentrus should be IdenTrust‚Äù. While true, the quote (and incorrect spelling) is verbatim from the original source and therefore left it as it was originally published. The same is true of other varied and inconsistent spellings, such as that of tScheme, throughout the paper: it reproduces original sources exactly as they were written.', 'p.15. Regarding the Change of Address service: ‚ÄúThis later spawned the Tell Us Once service from DWP that started in 2011 and is still in use today for notification of death to be propagated across departments.‚Äù', 'p.20. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ paid directly by the user to the tScheme third party\xa0‚Ä¶‚Äù should be ‚Äúpaid directly by the user to the tScheme-accredited third party‚Äù. Any future update will include this clarification.', 'p.23. Regarding the registration and authentication framework: ‚ÄúNotable also for introducing the concept that level of registration (verification) and level of authentication were not necessarily the same. It gives the example of the online provision of an anonymous medical test that must have the result delivered to the correct person.‚Äù', 'p.29. The text towards the bottom of the page ‚ÄúIt also highlighted the requirements for identification and authentication‚Ä¶‚Äù refers to the European study describing the UK‚Äôs approach, and not specifically the Government Gateway. This is not sufficiently clear from the context, which could be taken to read as continuing to refer to the Government Gateway rather than the overall UK approach as described in the study. Any future updates will make this distinction clear, including that the later words in fact relate to another UK system operated by the DTI, referenced to illustrate how the UK‚Äôs approach was being adopted across multiple initiatives.', 'p.31. The Employee Authentication Service (EAS) is also notable in that ‚ÄúThis was the first initiative that realised that authorisation was essential for access to systems like Every Child Matters and Contact Point. It thus laid the foundation for the use of trusted attributes linked to online identities. To this end, tScheme even developed a new Approval Profile for Attribute Registration.‚Äù', 'p.46. An additional clarification has been suggested, namely that: ‚ÄúeIDAS does not provide standards for eIDs, only Trust Services. For identity services it just requires that all notified national schemes should inter-operate but based on national standards.‚Äù', 'Last update: 06.09.2020', 'Page 21. ‚ÄúThe Government Gateway store was encrypted: decryption\nof the appropriate identifier could only happen when users provided their credentials to authorise its release.‚Äù  ; also Page 45 ‚ÄúThe Government Gateway encrypted users‚Äô data, with the user the only one able to authorise its decryption. The specific identifier released as the output of the decryption process was the one relating to the service department\nrequesting it (e.g. Unique Tax Reference for HMRC, National Insurance Number for DWP):‚Äù.', 'I don‚Äôt believe this is accurate.  The identifiers table in the Government Gateway database held the enrolment identifier(s) (e.g. NINO, UTR), in clear text; not encrypted on a per user basis.      The user‚Äôs enrolments and identifiers were filtered in SAML assertions and API calls to the services associated with the calling portal, but no encryption/decryption of the identifiers was taking place.', 'Thanks Bryn ‚Äî that‚Äôs interesting feedback, do you have any citable references for that by any chance? I spoke with various developers and tech architects who provided and/or checked information in the paper, as well as reviewing original security documentation. It‚Äôs possible the design changed over time. There‚Äôs also potential ambiguity about whether the entire identifiers DB was encrypted at rest and only accessible to a trusted process invoked as part of creation/retrieval after successful authentication of users‚Äô credentials ‚Äî rather than encrypted on a per user basis. The design always aimed to block its use as any kind of central population register by preventing such access at a technical, not just a policy, level.', 'Hi Jerry,', 'It is interesting that we set out to solve these issues just over 4 years ago at Octopus.sh in a decentralised and distributed fashion, without using Blockchain.  You might be interested on a paper I wrote about our platform called ‚ÄúSelf Sovereign Networks‚Äù, that touches on identity, privacy, data integrity and data security https://octopus.sh/resources/VaultChain%C2%AE%20-%20A%20self-sovereign%20network.pdf', 'Would be great to chat further,', 'Cheers,', 'Neil', 'Thanks Neil ‚Äî I‚Äôll take a look.

Local governments in particular have to decide how much to invest in open data programs, and whether they should aim for feasible, short-term solutions, or impactful, long-term solutions. Most often, open data innovators are looking for something in the middle.', 'We created this taxonomy to help cities self-examine their open data maturity, and determine how exactly to improve or apply open data for local impact.', '', 'In order to even decide how to adapt open data for local impact, open data providers need to understand what their community members need. Once open data providers have a set of user personas and use cases in mind, they can choose to focus on one persona or use case where there‚Äôs a strong potential for local impact.', 'Open data providers with lower maturity might be able to make feasible, short-term improvements to open data that will set the stage for impact on the issues they care about in the long-term. Other, more mature open data providers, might be more prepared to provide grants or take on new partnerships that leverage open data for maximal community impact.', 'How does this connect to Tactical Data Engagement (TDE)?', 'Tactical Data Engagement requires exploring current and potential open data user needs (during the Discovery Phase) and then working with users to design and execute an open data intervention to support those needs (during the Action Phase). A TDE intervention is a key concept as cities look to put open data user research into action.', 'What is a TDE intervention?', 'Simply put, a tactical open data intervention is whatever short-term action a city decides to take to help members of the community use city data. As such, an intervention can be thought of as a ‚Äúprototype,‚Äù ‚Äúpilot,‚Äù or ‚Äúbeta launch‚Äù of any new data, guidance, communication, project, initiative, tool, or partnership to support open data‚Äôs use.', 'Often, the most feasible solutions to help community members start with undoing the barriers to access to information. At a fundamental level, community members cannot use data that they do not have access to.', 'Although many open data providers have found, through their work, that just publishing data does not alone generate ‚Äúimpact,‚Äù basic open data still plays a foundational role in enabling government transparency and accountability. Tackling fundamental access to information is where most open data programs start, but it is most certainly not where they should end.', 'Opening access to public information or open data can mean publishing it online, but it can also mean removing technical requirements for accessing data, removing legal protections, or compiling data to a central or easy-to-find location.', 'Beyond just providing access to relevant open data, open data providers need to design data releases for specific uses, which means making intentional choices about the way in which the data is presented.\xa0', 'At this level, open data providers may have published some raw data in a basic format, but users who can use the data to generate the most impact may prefer data that‚Äôs presented as holistic indicators, or as interactive maps, or as analytic visualizations. It‚Äôs impossible to know until data providers get out into the community and refine their understanding of community needs for information.\xa0', 'Open data providers need to be aware that even with strong user research and an initial understanding of community issues, users‚Äô needs will change and potential applications will evolve as local issues evolve. The only way to ensure that open data remains relevant and actionable is to build channels for data owners to continuously collect and respond to community needs.\xa0', 'At its best, open data can help start a dialogue between governments and their residents by giving people a shared foundation to discuss issues relevant to their communities. Although data might be at the core of a healthy, facts-based dialogue, it‚Äôs more important for residents to feel that their needs are being heard. For residents to provide input on public matters, governments need to commit to responsiveness as a core part of transparency.', 'Interventions that build channels for responsiveness revolve around establishing the necessary infrastructure for future open data managers to have the input they need to make ongoing quality improvements. Establishing these channels often feels small, but incorporating feedback into various open data workflows is a big step toward making open data actionable and impactful in the long-term.\xa0', 'If there are ways to apply open data where certain community groups or users have already tried and succeeded, open data providers should highlight and share those successes for future users. Often, data portals only hold data from one provider, but if community partners have built tools that address specific research questions, data owners should make an effort to connect users to those solutions. Users can either replicate successful open data applications or recognize when their work would duplicate someone else‚Äôs efforts, thus leading to stronger collaboration and opening the door for more community impact through open data.', 'Interventions might take the form of showcases or story maps that show users specific open data applications, or ‚Äúsuper-documentation‚Äù like instruction manuals to help users replicate solutions. Depending on the local open data environment, open data providers may have to go outside of their communities to find helpful success stories.', 'Open data providers can foster long-term progress toward impactful tech and data use by investing in community supports that involve equal participation from local governments, technologists, community experts, and residents. Note that enabling effective participation from these four groups sometimes requires having completed the necessary open data improvements from earlier maturity levels.', 'Many civic tech efforts have begun with building communities around technology use, but have not taken into account the various barriers to access, use, responsiveness, and effective applications that might exist in their work. Many civic tech projects have failed due to a lack of integration into the communities that are most deeply affected by social and economic issues that concern local governments.', 'Interventions that catalyze strong civic tech and open data ecosystems can seek to convene members from across backgrounds to ensure that those most affected local issues have a voice in developing innovative data and technology solutions. Building the connective tissue between people who have lived experience of local issues and those who have the skills to implement solutions can help foster a place-based culture of inclusive collaboration and experimentation.', 'For governments', 'At the end of the day, impactful open data applications require actual financial or in-kind investment in groups with subject matter expertise. Open data is just one component of solving local challenges, and it must be combined with social efforts to reform public policies and programs in order to bring about impactful data-driven solutions.', 'This level of intervention requires for open data providers to collaborate and share power with external partners who can use open data to complete their work in support of community development or well-being. Partners may be actively involved in data collection, maintenance and quality assurance, or in the use and application of relevant data. Local governments in particular should take an equity mindset to their community partnerships and investigate how open data can help empower and uplift community-driven movements to create the change they want to see.']","['https://sunlightfoundation.com/', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/10/16/results-from-analyzing-public-record-requests/', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/10/16/results-from-analyzing-public-record-requests/', 'https://opendefinition.org/guide/data/', 'https://datastandards.directory/', 'https://feedbacklabs.org/feedback-loops-steps/', 'https://labs.centerforgov.org/data-governance/data-inventory/', 'http://www.wprdc.org/data-user-groups/', 'http://www.wprdc.org/data-user-guides/', 'https://data.cambridgema.gov/widgets/x96z-hdnh', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/open-cities/', 'https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/', 'https://communities.sunlightfoundation.com', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/', 'https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/open-cities/', 'https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/']","{'cambridgema.gov', 'centerforgov.org', 'opendefinition.org', 'bloomberg.org', 'datastandards.directory', 'sunlightfoundation.com', 'wprdc.org', 'feedbacklabs.org'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our public records tool has helped tens of thousands of people file requests on issues of public importance around the United States, while DocumentCloud makes it easy for newsrooms to post their primary source materials for everyone to see.', 'Overall, we‚Äôve helped create a public corpus of over a hundred million pages of primary source materials. But over the last few years, we‚Äôve seen that just having access to information is not enough. To reach the web‚Äôs democratic potential, it needs to be easier to make sense of that information while building a deeper sense of public investment in healthy, trusted information ecosystems.', 'That challenge is particularly amplified as we grapple with the international COVID-19 crisis, taking a toll on every community but in different ways. Now, with millions isolated and looking for a way to help, we think we‚Äôve come up with one way to help: Source Scour.', 'Building on MuckRock‚Äôs existing Assignments crowdsourcing tool, Source Scour will make it easy to quickly rally volunteers to help find, catalogue, and preserve primary source materials.Using an easily customizable form, newsrooms and researchers can define a set of tasks for others to complete.', 'Working with our network of thousands of newsrooms and tens of thousands of contributors, we plan to collect crucial details in a way that helps showcase effective public health interventions and policies while helping everyone better understand the full impact of COVID-19 across North America.', 'This support will also allow us to directly bake WikiData into MuckRock and Assignments. To start, we‚Äôre taking our existing database of 16,258 government agencies and over 33,000 jurisdictions and mapping them to respective WikiData entries. Once integrated, we‚Äôll be able to both bring richer data into our profiles of these entities, such as population and demographic information, as well as make it easier for MuckRock users to contribute new data to the WikiData commons in a way that retains appropriately tagged metadata.', 'Entity resolution ‚Äî making sure that you‚Äôre not only comparing apples to apples but that two apples are, indeed, the same apple ‚Äî is a challenging problem in journalism and civic technology, and we‚Äôre excited about the potential to help simplify this process with both these first steps and more integrations to come.', 'Longer term, we‚Äôre working on adding WikiData-based entity resolution throughout MuckRock and DocumentCloud‚Äôs portfolio, so that as you read through responsive records you can quickly find out more about unfamiliar names or places. We believe that by getting other journalistic tools to follow a similar approach, it will be easier to integrate investigative tools and discover previously hidden linkages.', 'More collaborative, crowdsourced approaches to gathering and vetting source materials can help fill a serious hole in local journalism around the world, bridging the public‚Äôs curiosity and desire to be informed with an increasingly challenging information landscape.', 'This is a first step towards that vision, and we believe an important one as we work to better understand the extent of the COVID-19 crisis and our public leaders‚Äô response to it. To get updates on the project, please join our mailing list. We‚Äôre excited to launch soon, as well as send updates about upcoming related trainings, news articles, and opportunities to get involved.', 'If you‚Äôre interested in contributing to a project, or have experience integrating WikiData into your own data journalism project, I‚Äôd also love to hear from you directly as we work on building this project out.', 'The WikiCred Grants Initiative supports research, software projects and Wikimedia events that explore information reliability and credibility.

Also, that it works in a way that is equitable and stable. As states digitise their public services, enable the use of digital identities by wider society, and make greater use of data in policymaking, how should government leaders ensure they maintain these principles?', 'This first blog looks at the concept of data usage trackers ‚Äî a way for a member of the public to view a log of how data about them has been used.', 'Greater use of data to deliver public services opens up new and increased opportunities for real and perceived misuse of data. Examples range from isolated instances of individual public servants accessing data for malicious purposes - such as the example of the leaking of data about 14,000 people diagnosed with HIV in Singapore, to fears about the use of technology provided by external suppliers - such as the debate around the use of technology by the NHS during the current pandemic.', 'Digital public services can also result in a data ecosystem that is opaque to the public and their proxies. Recent user research by the UK Government Digital Service, for example, found that ‚Äúpeople assume that data about them is already held centrally in government‚Äù, and a similar effort by the Canadian government‚Äôs Tell Us Once programme similarly found that the public ‚Äúassume data is shared by default‚Äù1. While in reality, data use is complex and has real-world consequences - as researchers at medConfidential found when trying to piece together the data flows of the UK‚Äôs Universal Credit welfare system; or when Public Health England had concerns about data sharing between the health and immigration systems in the UK.', 'In many countries, the public have rights to understand how data about them is used ‚Äî such as the rights provided under GDPR ‚Äî but, in practice, these often require people to actively request information is disclosed, and for them to know who to request it from. Data usage trackers are interesting, in part, because they provide a complementary approach to general data rights. By providing a single, central, service, a member of the public can view a log of how data about them has been used and by whom, without having to understand the structure of government.', 'What follows is a description of three examples of data usage trackers from Estonia, India and Chile. Descriptions are based on interviews with the teams responsible for them, and from public documents. The aim is to detail some basic facts about how these systems work so that designers and policy-makers in other governments looking to adopt or critique similar measures have a better starting point for their own work.', '', 'An example screenshot of the AndmejaÃàlgija service, published by the Estonian Government', 'If a user has doubts or questions regarding the use of data, they can contact either the data requester or the data provider directly. The level of control varies to some extent, with additional controls for health data that allow users to explicitly restrict access to certain datasets (although users see a message advising against this). There is no central process for raising a query ‚Äî users need to email the agency concerned. If that approach does not provide enough answers, the Data Protection Inspectorate provides a point of further escalation for the public.\xa0\xa0', 'According to Sander Randorg, the product owner for AndmejaÃàlgija, the service gets approximately 30,000 visits a month (an increase since it was given a more prominent position on eesti.ee). Some of those visits also come from government agencies who signpost the service to eliminate the need for manual enquiries. Not all agencies are included in the service, although there are moves to increase the number using it and eventually make it universal.2\xa0The source code for AndmejaÃàlgija is published in the open along with documentation about how agencies can integrate with the service.', ""Randorg says the team receives a lot of positive attention and feedback for the service from the public. ‚ÄúBy creating a unified way of recording the data usage logs to the public (i.e. a protocol) and a single point of access assures that people will find and understand the contents of such a service‚Äù. Although communicating what has happened to users is not without challenges: ‚ÄúRight now we are rather explaining the data set itself, rather than the actual reason behind its use by a third party. What could be said from the quantifiable feedback we've received is that the reasons [for access] (e.g. a legal basis, a consent, data subjects own request etc.) are important to people and the better you describe the intentions the happier (or at least content with the data use happening) the public seems to be.‚Äù"", 'Randorg says that the service is made substantially easier to manage due to Estonia‚Äôs unified X-Road data access platform. ‚ÄúWe have a solid foundation by using X-Road as our transportation layer, as it is quite easy to modify the services technology-wise. It is a whole other story when we talk about redesigning hundreds of data exchange services to accommodate these kinds of features‚Äù. He suggests that teams from other countries developing similar services need to ensure that their data exchange systems are designed with a ‚Äútransparency by design‚Äù mindset. And that the same mindset should guide the way audit logs are created inside public agencies: ‚Äúit should be expected that most if not all of the information should be accessible by the public‚Äù. He also points out that in Estonia, transparency is quite unanimously accepted as something necessary in the relations between the citizen and the government.', 'Luukas Ilves, former digital policy lead during Estonia‚Äôs 2017 EU Presidency, and now head of Strategy at Guardtime, also made this point. ‚ÄúThere is an expectation by Estonians of no misuse, and there is a clear understanding by public servants of data protection measures. They know that there is auditing and that improper data access will be discovered. Transparency measures work on a systemic level, even if only 0.01% of people actively avail themselves of them‚Äù. News coverage of misuse of data, such as a recent example of a medical worker aiding a police officer to check up on their spouse, helps to reinforce public understanding.\xa0', 'While Estonia‚Äôs data tracker aims to help citizens understand when data from a government registry has been used, the Indian government‚Äôs Aadhaar Authentication History service aims to help it‚Äôs users understand when their government issued digital identity has been used. Linked to from the Unique Identification Authority of India‚Äôs (UIDAI) website, Aadhaar Authentication History gives users access to a six month authentication history for their Aadhaar identity.', 'It was not possible to interview someone from the Aadhaar Authentication History team, but UIDAI‚Äôs FAQ‚Äôs and tutorial videos explain the information that is presented to users.3 4 5', 'Example screenshot Aadhaar Authentication History (2017) published by UIDAI', 'Example screenshot Aadhaar Authentication History (2019) published by UIDAI', 'This includes a timestamp for each authentication, if the authentication was successful, the method (e.g. biometrics or a one-time passcode), the name of the service or agency that was accessed using the identity (called an Authentication User Agency), and any error or response codes, which are displayed as a number e.g. 800 means ‚Äúinvalid biometric data‚Äù. As with the Estonian data usage tracker, users who spot something anomalous need to contact the agency concerned directly, there is no inbuilt escalation route.', 'In addition to Aadhaar Authentication History, UIDAI also operates a separate service for viewing and checking historical updates to the data held against the Aadhaar account, such as a user‚Äôs address.6 7', 'Clave√önica is Chile‚Äôs digital identity platform. It is built on top of the existing civil identity registry and uses the OpenID Connect standard. Over nine million Chileans have a Clave√önica account and it is integrated into services provided by multiple government agencies.', 'When signed in to their Clave√önica account, a user can access a basic data tracker called ‚Äòmi actividad‚Äô (‚Äòmy activity‚Äô). It is similar to the Aadhaar Authentication History service, in that it allows users to see when their identity has been used to sign in to a digital service, and the organisation responsible for that service.', 'Example screenshot Clave√önica Mi actividad, provided by the product team', 'The current functionality of mi actividad is quite basic, but the team is actively developing the service and have plans for a more powerful system. This work is taking place alongside the development of an interoperability network for the exchange of data between different government agencies.', 'Emilio Mu√±oz, product owner for Clave√önica, and Francisco De la Carrera Sep√∫lveda, product owner for interoperability, described their ambition to use this interoperability network and the Clave√önica account as a base for a broader data tracker service along the lines of Estonia‚Äôs. ""We are aiming for the Estonian example. Citizens will be able to give or deny access to an institution"". They also explained that the way the government is organised is different from Estonia, meaning the technology approach must be different - ‚Äúdepartments are more like islands, so we have to adapt to the technology of the departments"".', 'The Clave√önica team see transparency as important for the further uptake of the platform. ‚ÄúToday we have 9 million users, but we need different strategies for reaching more users. Trust and transparency are part of the digital inclusion strategy.‚Äù', 'Data trackers are clearly an emergent pattern and it is unlikely that these examples will transpose exactly to other states. Different attitudes to privacy, rights structures and technology landscapes will all play a part. There are, however, some questions raised by these examples that other countries should consider.', 'Firstly, the designs are relatively basic. Users must spot anomalies from relatively sparse information and, in the case of Aadhaar, understand technical error codes. With few examples to copy, and limited parallels in the private sector, this is understandable (Google‚Äôs My Activity is one, rare, example). This is clearly an area that would benefit from more user centred design research to understand different ways of making this information meaningful to users, and for different governments to share their learnings in the open.', 'Secondly, all three represent examples of using technology and design to abstract the structure of government, while simultaneously creating space to describe the actions of the institutions making use of data. There is one place to understand interactions with a range of government agencies. They also represent a piece of shared infrastructure for government - a platform for agencies to make use of.\xa0 Countries looking to emulate this approach will need to ask themselves if\xa0 they have the capability in place to design and operate such a shared central platform.', 'Finally, data trackers are designed around the idea of an individual citizen playing the role of guardian against the misuse of the data that is held about them. The question that needs to be asked is: which types of user does this serve and is it enough? Data trackers feel like ‚Äúpower user‚Äù tools. That may be ok, if by their very existence and use by a minority of users they contribute to public trust? Or maybe additional tools need to exist to support users to understand how data about them is used, either at the point of use of services or through third sector organisations?', 'If there is one underlying principle that may be replicable, it is this: while citizens should not have to understand how data about them is used by the state to interact with it, that does not have to mean denying them routes to do so when the circumstances demand it. Estonia, India and Chile are actively exploring how to achieve this.', '\xa01\xa0‚ÄúTell Us Once/Single Window Prototype: Research Through Design Final Summary Report‚Äù, 2020, Office of the Chief Information Officer of Canada & Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.', '2\xa0Interview with Luukas Ilves, former digital policy lead during Estonia‚Äôs 2017 EU Presidency, now head of Strategy at Guardtime.', '3\xa0""Aadhaar Authentication History"", uidai.gov.in, UIDAI', '4\xa0""TUTORIAL: How to check your Aadhaar Authentication History?"", YouTube, 23rd May 2019, UIDAI.', '5 ""Check your Aadhaar Authentication History online"", YouTube, 18th December 2017, UIDAI.', '6\xa0https://uidai.gov.in/images/news/Press-Release-on-Aadhaar-Update-History-06062018.pdf', '7\xa0https://www.uidai.gov.in/my-aadhaar/update-aadhaar.html', 'About the author', 'Richard was part of the founding team at the UK Government Digital Service, working as product manager for the first version of GOV.UK, which went on to win the Design of the Year award in 2013, and co-authoring the Digital by Default Service Standard, which ...\xa0\xa0\xa0Learn more \n\n\n', 'The Bennett Institute for Public Policy launched in April 2018.

191,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news,200,Wikipedia:In the news - Wikipedia,"['\nAdministrator instructions\n', 'view\xa0¬∑ history\xa0¬∑ related changes\xa0¬∑ edit\xa0¬∑ suggestions\n', 'The ""In the news"" (ITN) section on the Main Page serves to direct readers to articles that have been substantially updated to reflect recent or current events of wide interest.  ITN supports the central purpose of Wikipedia‚Äîmaking a great encyclopedia.\n', ""Unlike Wikipedia's sister project Wikinews, Wikipedia is not an online newspaper and does not accept original works of journalism or first-hand reports.  However, many Wikipedians are motivated to create and update encyclopedic articles of timely interest.  ITN originated in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when entries were created and put on the Main Page within minutes of the attacks.  The entries led to an infusion of interest by editors in creating a Main Page section that linked to articles providing readers the context behind the news.\n"", 'Events posted on ITN are listed in approximately reverse chronological order, with the more recent entries appearing first. They are generally not sorted by any degree of importance or significance. Events are added based on a consensus on the ITN candidates page, using two main criteria: a) the quality of the article, including material added or updated to reflect the recent event, and b) the general significance of the developments.\n', 'Candidates for ITN are evaluated on two main grounds: a) the quality of the article and its updated content, and b) the significance of the developments described.  In many cases, qualities in one area can make up for deficiencies in another.  For example, a highly significant event, such as the discovery of a cure for cancer, may have a sub-par update associated with it, but be posted anyway with the assumption that other editors will soon join in and improve the article.  Conversely, an editor may write an in-depth update on a topic normally considered marginal, thus convincing commenters that it is deserving of inclusion.  A successful nomination will normally go through several procedural steps before being added to the ITN template.\n', 'Each ITN item contains an emboldened link to an article providing a substantial quantity of directly relevant information, attributed to reliable sources.  Typically, the article has been updated to include this text or created in response to the recent/current event.\n', 'The decision as to when an article is updated enough is subjective, but a five-sentence update (with at minimum three references, not counting duplicates) is generally more than sufficient, while a one-sentence update is highly questionable.  Changes in verb tense (e.g. ""is"" ‚Üí ""was"") or updates that convey little or no relevant information beyond what is stated in the ITN blurb are insufficient.    \n', 'In the case of a new, event-specific article, the traditional cut-off for what is enough has been around three complete, referenced and well-formed paragraphs.  An example of the minimum required update for a new article is Fuzhou derailment at the time of its posting.\n', 'If the recent/current event relates directly to previous occurrences (e.g. a major award honoring past achievements), the article can be considered sufficiently updated when there is consensus that it contains appropriate, up-to-date coverage of the entire chronology, irrespective of when the text was written or how many sentences pertain specifically to the recent/current event (apart from the requirement that it be mentioned).\n', 'Updated content must be thoroughly referenced.  As with all Wikipedia articles, citations must be to reliable sources.  While articles on topics such as sporting events and economics lend themselves to tables of numbers, updates must be at least in part written in prose to qualify for ITN consideration.  References should be correctly formatted and not bare URLs.\n', ""Articles that are subject to serious issues, as indicated by 'orange'- or 'red'-level tags at either the article level or within any section, may not be accepted for an emboldened link.\n"", 'Whether a topic is significant enough for inclusion in ITN is often contentious, and ultimately, there are no rules or guidance beyond two:\n', 'It is highly subjective whether an event is considered significant enough, and ultimately each event should be discussed on its own merits. The consensus among those discussing the event is all that is necessary to decide if an event is significant enough for posting. Generally, proof that an event is being covered, in an in-depth manner, by news sources is required. Caution should be taken when assessing news sources for prominence, because most major news outlets provide individualized experiences for each user, based on geography and browsing history. What one user sees as a top headline may be buried for others, and vice versa. Do not assess whether a story is ""prominent"" or not based on where you see it reported on major news websites for this reason. Other principles may be helpful:\n', 'These sorts of principles are useful in convincing others to support or oppose posting a story. However, on their own none of them are sufficient to override consensus. Remember, the people you are attempting to convince is the rest of the community, not the admins, and it is rarely helpful to badger others who may have a different opinion.\n', 'Historically, the community has tended to frown upon certain types of arguments related to the significance of a story.  Any user may, of course, support or oppose a candidate for any reason, but be aware that the following arguments have historically not garnered much support:\n', 'One can get an idea for how certain topics are seen to meet the significance factor by reviewing the archives of ITN candidate discussions, which can be found organized by month at Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates/Archives. Editors are cautioned from necessarily relying on consensus from past discussions to bring forward support on a new ITN candidate, since each candidate is reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n', 'Articles are held to a minimum standard of quality.  Articles should be a minimally comprehensive overview of the subject, not omitting any major items.  Stub articles are never appropriate for the main page.  Articles should be well written with clear prose.  Articles which consist solely or mostly of lists and tables, with little narrative prose, are usually not acceptable for the main page, and prose should be in narrative style, not ""proseline""-type writing. Articles should be well referenced; one or two ""citation needed"" tags may not hold up an article, but any contentious statements must have a source, and having entire sections without any sources is unacceptable.  Biographies of living persons are held to higher standards of referencing because of their sensitive nature, and these rules also apply to those recently deceased.  Lists of awards and honors, bibliographies and filmographies and the like should have clear sources.  Sources themselves should be checked for reliability.  Generally, ""orange"" and ""red"" level clean-up tags are signs that article quality is not acceptable for the main page as well.\n', 'Blurbs are posted to the main page, highlighting one or more quality Wikipedia articles, as follows:\n', 'Most In The News postings come in the form of blurbs.  A blurb is a short explanation of the importance of the story in the news, with a specific article we are highlighting to direct readers to learn more information.  The highlighted article should always be of sufficient quality to be posted on the main page; this usually means:\n', 'Blurbs are posted in rough chronological order by the date when the event occurred.  There is usually no effort made to be more specific than the date, and admins will generally not research the exact minute when an event occurred to make sure that multiple events that occurred on the same date are strictly in order.  Please do not request that events be re-ordered unless the date itself is wrong.  The number of blurbs varies from time to time, depending on the length of each individual blurb and the relative lengths of other sections on the main page.  The goal is to avoid excessive white space, especially between the right and left columns, and older blurbs may be periodically removed or added to achieve this.\n', 'Some guidelines for the structuring of blurbs:\n', 'The ITN section usually has a captioned picture in the upper right corner.  Pictures generally must meet the following criteria:\n', 'The purpose of the ongoing section is to maintain a link to a continuously updated Wikipedia article about a story which is itself also frequently in the news.  The following criteria are usually used to post something to ongoing:\n', ""The items are placed in alphabetical order according to the links' displayed text.\n"", 'An individual human, animal or other biological organism that has recently died may have an entry in the recent deaths (RD) section if it has a biographical Wikipedia article that is:\n', 'Certain regularly recurring events are considered of sufficient interest to be placed on ITN every time they occur; they are listed at Wikipedia:In the news/Recurring items. Items listed there are considered exempt from having to prove their notability through discussion on the candidates page. However, it does not pre-empt the other ITN criteria. The relevant article(s) will still have to be updated and cited appropriately, and proposed on the candidates page before posting. \n', 'If an editor has concerns about the overall recurring event, such discussions should not take place on WP:ITN/C when one instance of an event is nominated. Instead, discussions on proposed inclusions and removals on the recurring items list should take place on Wikipedia talk:In the news.\n', ""The templates {{ITN notice}} and {{ITN talk}} are used to notify interested parties that an article was bold-linked from ITN.

Democracy is good. War is bad. And of course, all men are created equal.', 'My mother was a teacher who encouraged me to question everything. But I quickly learned that some questions were taboo. Is democracy inherently good? Is the military ethical? Does God exist?', 'I loved pushing people‚Äôs buttons with these philosophical questions, but they weren‚Äôt nearly as existentially destabilizing as the moments in my life in which my experiences didn‚Äôt line up with frames that were sacred cows in my community. Police were revered, so my boss didn‚Äôt believe me when I told him that cops were forcing me to give them free food, which is why there was food missing. Pastors were moral authorities and so our pastor‚Äôs infidelities were not to be discussed, at least not among us youth. Forgiveness is a beautiful thing, but hypocrisy is destabilizing. Nothing can radicalize someone more than feeling like you‚Äôre being lied to. Or when the world order you‚Äôve adopted comes crumbling down.', 'The funny thing about education is that we ask our students to challenge their assumptions. And that process can be enlightening.', 'The funny thing about education is that we ask our students to challenge their assumptions. And that process can be enlightening. I will never forget being a teenager and reading ‚ÄúThe People‚Äôs History of the United States.‚Äù The idea that there could be multiple histories, multiple truths blew my mind. Realizing that history is written by the winners shook me to my core. This is the power of education. But the hole that opens up, that invites people to look for new explanations‚Ä¶that hole can be filled in deeply problematic ways. When we ask students to challenge their sacred cows but don‚Äôt give them a new framework through which to make sense of the world, others are often there to do it for us.', 'For the last year, I‚Äôve been struggling with media literacy. I have a deep level of respect for the primary goal. As Renee Hobbs has written, media literacy is the ‚Äúactive inquiry and critical thinking about the messages we receive and create.‚Äù The field talks about the development of competencies or skills to help people analyze, evaluate, and even create media. Media literacy is imagined to be empowering, enabling individuals to have agency and giving them the tools to help create a democratic society. But fundamentally, it is a form of critical thinking that asks people to doubt what they see. And that makes me nervous.', 'Most media literacy proponents tell me that media literacy doesn‚Äôt exist in schools. And it‚Äôs true that the ideal version that they‚Äôre aiming for definitely doesn‚Äôt. But I spent a decade in and out of all sorts of schools in the US, where I quickly learned that a perverted version of media literacy does already exist. Students are asked to distinguish between CNN and Fox. Or to identify bias in a news story. When tech is involved, it often comes in the form of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust Wikipedia; use Google.‚Äù We might collectively dismiss these practices as not-media-literacy, but these activities are often couched in those terms.', 'I‚Äôm painfully aware of this, in part because media literacy is regularly proposed as the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to the so-called ‚Äúfake news‚Äù problem. I hear this from funders and journalists, social media companies and elected officials. My colleagues Monica Bulger and Patrick Davison just released a report on media literacy in light of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù given the gaps in current conversations. I don‚Äôt know what version of media literacy they‚Äôre imagining but I‚Äôm pretty certain it‚Äôs not the CNN vs Fox News version. Yet, when I drill in, they often argue for the need to combat propaganda, to get students to ask where the money is coming from, to ask who is writing the stories for what purposes, to know how to fact-check, etcetera. And when I push them further, I often hear decidedly liberal narratives. They talk about the Mercers or about InfoWars or about the Russians. They mock ‚Äúalternative facts.‚Äù While I identify as a progressive, I am deeply concerned by how people understand these different conservative phenomena and what they see media literacy as solving.', 'I get that many progressive communities are panicked about conservative media, but we live in a polarized society and I worry about how people judge those they don‚Äôt understand or respect. It also seems to me that the narrow version of media literacy that I hear as the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù is supposed to magically solve our political divide. It won‚Äôt. More importantly, as I‚Äôm watching social media and news media get weaponized, I‚Äôm deeply concerned that the well-intended interventions I hear people propose will backfire, because I‚Äôm fairly certain that the crass versions of critical thinking already have.', 'My talk today is intended to interrogate some of the foundations upon which educating people about the media landscape depends. Rather than coming at this from the idealized perspective, I am trying to come at this from the perspective of where good intentions might go awry, especially in a moment in which narrow versions of media literacy and critical thinking are being proposed as the solution to major socio-cultural issues. I want to examine the instability of our current media ecosystem to then return to the question of: what kind of media literacy should we be working towards? So let‚Äôs dig in.', 'In 2017, sociologist Francesca Tripodi was trying to understand how conservative communities made sense of the seemingly contradictory words coming out of the mouth of the US President. Along her path, she encountered people talking about making sense of The Word when referencing his speeches. She began accompanying people in her study to their bible study groups. Then it clicked. Trained on critically interrogating biblical texts, evangelical conservative communities were not taking Trump‚Äôs messages as literal text. They were interpreting their meanings using the same epistemological framework as they approached the bible. Metaphors and constructs matter more than the precision of words.', 'Why do we value precision in language? I sat down for breakfast with Gillian Tett, a Financial Times journalist and anthropologist. She told me that when she first moved to the States from the UK, she was confounded by our inability to talk about class. She was trying to make sense of what distinguished class in America. In her mind, it wasn‚Äôt race. Or education. It came down to what construction of language was respected and valued by whom. People became elite by mastering the language marked as elite. Academics, journalists, corporate executives, traditional politicians: they all master the art of communication. I did too. I will never forget being accused of speaking like an elite by my high school classmates when I returned home after a semester of college. More importantly, although it‚Äôs taboo in America to be explicitly condescending towards people on the basis of race or education, there‚Äôs no social cost among elites to mock someone for an inability to master language. For using terms like ‚Äúshithole.‚Äù', 'Linguistic and communications skills are not universally valued. Those who do not define themselves through this skill loathe hearing the never-ending parade of rich and powerful people suggesting that they‚Äôre stupid, backwards, and otherwise lesser. Embracing being anti-PC has become a source of pride, a tactic of resistance. Anger boils over as people who reject ‚Äúthe establishment‚Äù are happy to watch the elites quiver over their institutions being dismantled. This is why this is a culture war. Everyone believes they are part of the resistance.', 'But what‚Äôs at the root of this cultural war? Cory Doctorow got me thinking when he wrote the following:', 'We‚Äôre not living through a crisis about what is true, we‚Äôre living through a crisis about how we know whether something is true. We‚Äôre not disagreeing about facts, we‚Äôre disagreeing about epistemology. The ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù version of epistemology is, ‚ÄúWe use evidence to arrive at the truth, vetted by independent verification (but trust us when we tell you that it‚Äôs all been independently verified by people who were properly skeptical and not the bosom buddies of the people they were supposed to be fact-checking).‚Äù', 'The ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù epistemological method goes like this: ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòindependent‚Äô experts who were supposed to be verifying the ‚Äòevidence-based‚Äô truth were actually in bed with the people they were supposed to be fact-checking. In the end, it‚Äôs all a matter of faith, then: you either have faith that ‚Äòtheir‚Äô experts are being truthful, or you have faith that we are. Ask your gut, what version feels more truthful?‚Äù', 'Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî most of us educators are deeply committed to a way of knowing that is rooted in evidence, reason, and fact. But who gets to decide what constitutes a fact? In philosophy circles, social constructivists challenge basic tenets like fact, truth, reason, and evidence. Yet, it doesn‚Äôt take a doctorate of philosophy to challenge the dominant way of constructing knowledge. Heck, 75 years ago, evidence suggesting black people were biologically inferior was regularly used to justify discrimination. And this was called science!', 'In many Native communities, experience trumps Western science as the key to knowledge. These communities have a different way of understanding topics like weather or climate or medicine. Experience is also used in activist circles as a way of seeking truth and challenging the status quo. Experience-based epistemologies also rely on evidence, but not the kind of evidence that would be recognized or accepted by those in Western scientific communities.', 'Those whose worldview is rooted in religious faith, particularly Abrahamic religions, draw on different types of information to construct knowledge. Resolving scientific knowledge and faith-based knowledge has never been easy; this tension has countless political and social ramifications. As a result, American society has long danced around this yawning gulf and tried to find solutions that can appease everyone. But you can‚Äôt resolve fundamental epistemological differences through compromise.', 'No matter what worldview or way of knowing someone holds dear, they always believe that they are engaging in critical thinking when developing a sense of what is right and wrong, true and false, honest and deceptive. But much of what they conclude may be more rooted in their way of knowing than any specific source of information.', 'If we‚Äôre not careful, ‚Äúmedia literacy‚Äù and ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù will simply be deployed as an assertion of authority over epistemology.', 'Right now, the conversation around fact-checking has already devolved to suggest that there‚Äôs only one truth. And we have to recognize that there are plenty of students who are taught that there‚Äôs only one legitimate way of knowing, one accepted worldview. This is particularly dicey at the collegiate level, where us professors have been taught nothing about how to teach across epistemologies.', 'Personally, it took me a long time to recognize the limits of my teachers. Like many Americans in less-than-ideal classrooms, I was taught that history was a set of facts to be memorized. When I questioned those facts, I was sent to the principal‚Äôs office for disruption. Frustrated and confused, I thought that I was being force-fed information for someone else‚Äôs agenda. Now I can recognize that that teacher was simply exhausted, underpaid, and waiting for retirement. But it took me a long time to realize that there was value in history and that history is a powerful tool.', 'The political scientist Deen Freelon was trying to make sense of the role of critical thinking to address ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù He ended up looking back at a fascinating campaign by Russian Today (known as RT). Their motto for a while was ‚Äúquestion more.‚Äù They produced a series of advertisements as teasers for their channel. These advertisements were promptly banned in the US and UK, resulting in RT putting up additional ads about how they were banned and getting tremendous mainstream media coverage about being banned. What was so controversial? Here‚Äôs an example:', '‚ÄúJust how reliable is the evidence that suggests human activity impacts on climate change? The answer isn‚Äôt always clear-cut. And it‚Äôs only possible to make a balanced judgement if you are better informed. By challenging the accepted view, we reveal a side of the news that you wouldn‚Äôt normally see. Because we believe that the more you question, the more you know.‚Äù', 'If you don‚Äôt start from a place where you‚Äôre confident that climate change is real, this sounds quite reasonable. Why wouldn‚Äôt you want more information? Why shouldn‚Äôt you be engaged in critical thinking? Isn‚Äôt this what you‚Äôre encouraged to do at school? So why is asking this so taboo? And lest you think that this is a moment to be condescending towards climate deniers, let me offer another one of their ads.', '‚ÄúIs terror only committed by terrorists? The answer isn‚Äôt always clear-cut. And it‚Äôs only possible to make a balanced judgement if you are better informed. By challenging the accepted view, we reveal a side of the news that you wouldn‚Äôt normally see. Because we believe that the more you question, the more you know.‚Äù', 'Many progressive activists ask whether or not the US government commits terrorism in other countries. The ads all came down because they were too political, but RT got what they wanted: an effective ad campaign. They didn‚Äôt come across as conservative or liberal, but rather a media entity that was ‚Äúcensored‚Äù for asking questions. Furthermore, by covering the fact that they were banned, major news media legitimized their frame under the rubric of ‚Äúfree speech.‚Äù Under the assumption that everyone should have the right to know and to decide for themselves.', 'We live in a world now where we equate free speech with the right to be amplified. Does everyone have the right to be amplified? Social media gave us that infrastructure under the false imagination that if we were all gathered in one place, we‚Äôd find common ground and eliminate conflict. We‚Äôve seen this logic before. After World War II, the world thought that connecting the globe through financial interdependence would prevent World War III. It‚Äôs not clear that this logic will hold.', 'For better and worse, by connecting the world through social media and allowing anyone to be amplified, information can spread at record speed. There is no true curation or editorial control. The onus is on the public to interpret what they see. To self-investigate. Since we live in a neoliberal society that prioritizes individual agency, we double down on media literacy as the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to misinformation. It‚Äôs up to each of us as individuals to decide for ourselves whether or not what we‚Äôre getting is true.', 'Yet, if you talk with someone who has posted clear, unquestionable misinformation, more often than not, they know it‚Äôs bullshit. Or they don‚Äôt care whether or not it‚Äôs true. Why do they post it then? Because they‚Äôre making a statement. The people who posted this meme (figure 1) didn‚Äôt bother to fact check this claim. They didn‚Äôt care. What they wanted to signal loud and clear is that they hated Hillary Clinton. And that message was indeed heard loud and clear. As a result, they are very offended if you tell them that they‚Äôve been duped by Russians into spreading propaganda. They don‚Äôt believe you for one second.', 'Misinformation is contextual. Most people believe that people they know are gullible to false information, but that they themselves are equipped to separate the wheat from the chaff. There‚Äôs widespread sentiment that we can fact check and moderate our way out of this conundrum. This will fail. Don‚Äôt forget that for many people in this country, both education and the media are seen as the enemy ‚Äî two institutions who are trying to have power over how people think. Two institutions that are trying to assert authority over epistemology.', 'Growing up on Usenet, Godwin‚Äôs Law was more than an adage to me. I spent countless nights lured into conversation by the idea that someone was wrong on the internet. And I long ago lost count about how many of them ended up with someone invoking Hitler or the Holocaust. I might have even been to blame in some of these conversations.', 'Fast forward 15 years to the point when Nathan Poe wrote a poignant comment on an online forum dedicated to Christianity: ‚ÄúWithout a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won‚Äôt mistake for the genuine article.‚Äù Poe‚Äôs Law, as it became known, signals that it‚Äôs hard to tell the difference between an extreme view and a parody of an extreme view on the internet.', 'In their book, ‚ÄúThe Ambivalent Internet,‚Äùmedia studies scholars Whitney Phillips and Ryan Milner highlight how a segment of society has become so well-versed at digital communications ‚Äî memes, GIFs, videos, etc. ‚Äî that they can use these tools of expression to fundamentally destabilize others‚Äô communication structures and worldviews. It‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs fiction, what‚Äôs cruel and what‚Äôs a joke. But that‚Äôs the point. That is how irony and ambiguity can be weaponized. And for some, the goal is simple: dismantle the very foundations of elite epistemological structures that are so deeply rooted in fact and evidence.', 'Many people, especially young people, turn to online communities to make sense of the world around them. They want to ask uncomfortable questions, interrogate assumptions, and poke holes at things they‚Äôve heard. Welcome to youth. There are some questions that are unacceptable to ask in public and they‚Äôve learned that. But in many online fora, no question or intellectual exploration is seen as unacceptable. To restrict the freedom of thought is to censor. And so all sorts of communities have popped up for people to explore questions of race and gender and other topics in the most extreme ways possible. And these communities have become slippery. Are those taking on such hateful views real? Or are they being ironic?', 'In the 1999 film The Matrix, Morpheus says to Neo: ‚ÄúYou take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.‚Äù Most youth aren‚Äôt interested in having the wool pulled over their head, even if blind faith might be a very calming way of living. Restricted in mobility and stressed to holy hell, they want to have access to what‚Äôs inaccessible, know what‚Äôs taboo, and say what‚Äôs politically incorrect. So who wouldn‚Äôt want to take the red pill?', 'In some online communities, taking the red pill refers to the idea of waking up to how education and media are designed to deceive you into progressive propaganda. In these environments, visitors are asked to question more. They‚Äôre invited to rid themselves of their politically correct shackles. There‚Äôs an entire online university designed to undo accepted ideas about diversity, climate, and history. Some communities are even more extreme in their agenda. These are all meant to fill in the gaps for those who are opening to questioning what they‚Äôve been taught.', 'In 2012, it was hard not to avoid the names Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, but that didn‚Äôt mean that most people understood the storyline. In South Carolina, a white teenager who wasn‚Äôt interested in the news felt like he needed to know what the fuss was all about. He decided to go to Wikipedia to understand more. He was left with the impression that Zimmerman was clearly in the right and disgusted that everyone was defending Martin. While reading up on this case, he ran across the term ‚Äúblack on white crime‚Äù on Wikipedia and decided to throw that term into Google where he encountered a deeply racist website inviting him to wake up to a reality that he had never considered. He took that red pill and dove deep into a worldview whose theory of power positioned white people as victims. Over a matter of years, he began to embrace those views, to be radicalized towards extreme thinking. On June 17, 2015, he sat down for an hour with a group of African-American church-goers in Charleston South Carolina before opening fire on them, killing 9 and injuring 1. His goal was simple: he wanted to start a race war.', 'It‚Äôs easy to say that this domestic terrorist was insane or irrational, but he began his exploration trying to critically interrogate the media coverage of a story he didn‚Äôt understand. That led him to online fora filled with people who have spent decades working to indoctrinate people into a deeply troubling, racist worldview. They draw on countless amounts of ‚Äúevidence,‚Äù engage in deeply persuasive discursive practices, and have the mechanisms to challenge countless assumptions. The difference between what is deemed missionary work, education, and radicalization depends a lot on your worldview. And your understanding of power.', 'The majority of Americans do not trust the news media. There are many explanations for this ‚Äî loss of local news, financial incentives, hard to distinguish between opinion and reporting, etc. But what does it mean to encourage people to be critical of the media‚Äôs narratives when they are already predisposed against the news media?', 'Perhaps you want to encourage people to think critically about how information is constructed, who is paying for it, and what is being left out. Yet, among those whose prior is to not trust a news media institution, among those who see CNN and The New York Times as ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù they‚Äôre already there. They‚Äôre looking for flaws. It‚Äôs not hard to find them. After all, the news industry is made of people in institutions in a society. So when youth are encouraged to be critical of the news media, they come away thinking that the media is lying. Depending on someone‚Äôs prior, they may even take what they learn to be proof that the media is in on the conspiracy. That‚Äôs where things get very dicey.', 'Many of my digital media and learning colleagues encourage people to make media to help understand how information is produced. Realistically, many young people have learned these skills outside the classroom as they seek to represent themselves on Instagram, get their friends excited about a meme, or gain followers on YouTube. Many are quite skilled at using media, but to what end? Every day, I watch teenagers produce anti-Semitic and misogynistic content using the same tools that activists use to combat prejudice. It‚Äôs notable that many of those who are espousing extreme viewpoints are extraordinarily skilled at using media. Today‚Äôs neo-Nazis are a digital propaganda machine. Developing media making skills doesn‚Äôt guarantee that someone will use them for good. This is the hard part.', 'Most of my peers think that if more people are skilled and more people are asking hard questions, goodness will see the light. In talking about misunderstandings of the First Amendment, Nabiha Syed of Buzzfeed highlights that the frame of the ‚Äúmarketplace of ideas‚Äù sounds great, but is extremely naive. Doubling down on investing in individuals as a solution to a systemic abuse of power is very American. But the best ideas don‚Äôt always surface to the top. Nervously, many of us tracking manipulation of media are starting to think that adversarial messages are far more likely to surface than well-intended ones.', 'This is not to say that we shouldn‚Äôt try to educate people. Or that producing critical thinkers is inherently a bad thing. I don‚Äôt want a world full of sheeple. But I also don‚Äôt want to naively assume what media literacy could do in responding to a culture war that is already underway. I want us to grapple with reality, not just the ideals that we imagine we could maybe one day build.', 'It‚Äôs one thing to talk about interrogating assumptions when a person can keep emotional distance from the object of study. It‚Äôs an entirely different thing to talk about these issues when the very act of asking questions is what‚Äôs being weaponized. This isn‚Äôt historical propaganda distributed through mass media. Or an exercise in understanding state power. This is about making sense of an information landscape where the very tools that people use to make sense of the world around them have been strategically perverted by other people who believe themselves to be resisting the same powerful actors that we normally seek to critique.', 'Take a look at the graph above. Can you guess what search term this is? This is the search query for ‚Äúcrisis actors.‚Äù This concept emerged as a conspiracy theory after Sandy Hook. Online communities worked hard to get this to land with the major news media after each shooting. With Parkland, they finally succeeded. Every major news outlet is now talking about crisis actors, as though it‚Äôs a real thing, or something to be debunked. When teenage witnesses of the mass shooting in Parkland speak to journalists these days, they have to now say that they are not crisis actors. They must negate a conspiracy theory that was created to dismiss them. A conspiracy theory that undermines their message from the get-go. And because of this, many people have turned to Google and Bing to ask what a crisis actor is. They quickly get to the Snopes page. Snopes provides a clear explanation of why this is a conspiracy. But you are now asked to not think of an elephant.', 'You may just dismiss this as craziness, but getting this narrative into the media was designed to help radicalize more people. Some number of people will keep researching, trying to understand what the fuss is all about. They‚Äôll find online fora discussing the images of a brunette woman and ask themselves if it might be the same person. They will try to understand the fight between David Hogg and Infowars or question why Infowars is being restricted by YouTube. They may think this is censorship. Seeds of doubt will start to form. And they‚Äôll ask whether or not any of the articulate people they see on TV might actually be crisis actors. That‚Äôs the power of weaponized narratives.', 'One of the main goals for those who are trying to manipulate media is to pervert the public‚Äôs thinking. It‚Äôs called gaslighting. Do you trust what is real? One of the best ways to gaslight the public is to troll the media. By getting the news media to be forced into negating frames, they can rely on the fact that people who distrust the media often respond by self-investigating. This is the power of the boomerang effect. And it has a history. After all, the CDC realized that the more news media negated the connection between autism and vaccination, the more the public believed there was something real there.', 'In 2016, I watched networks of online participants test this theory through an incident now known as Pizzagate. They worked hard to get the news media to negate the conspiracy theory, believing that this would prompt more people to try to research if there was something real there. They were effective. The news media covered the story to negate it. Lots of people decided to self-investigate. One guy even showed up with a gun.', 'The term ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù originates in the context of domestic violence. The term refers back to an 1944 movie called Gas Light where a woman is manipulated by her husband in a way that leaves her thinking she‚Äôs crazy. It‚Äôs a very effective technique of control. It makes someone submissive and disoriented, unable to respond to a relationship productively. While many anti-domestic violence activists argue that the first step is to understand that gaslighting exists, the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù is not to fight back against the person doing the gaslighting. Instead, it‚Äôs to get out. Furthermore, anti-domestic violence experts argue that recovery from gaslighting is a long and arduous process, requiring therapy. They recognize that once instilled, self-doubt is hard to overcome.', 'While we have many problems in our media landscape, the most dangerous is how it is being weaponized to gaslight people.', 'And unlike the domestic violence context, there is no ‚Äúgetting out‚Äù that is really possible in a media ecosystem. Sure, we can talk about going off the grid and opting out of social media and news media, but c‚Äômon now.', 'In 2017, Netflix released a show called 13 Reasons Why. Before parents and educators had even heard of the darn show, millions of teenagers had watched it. For most viewers, it was a fascinating show. The storyline was enticing, the acting was phenomenal. But I‚Äôm on the board of Crisis Text Line, an amazing service where people around this country talk with trained counselors via text message when they‚Äôre in a crisis. Before the news media even began talking about the show, we started to see the impact. After all, the premise of the show is that a teen girl died by suicide and left behind 13 tapes explaining how people had bullied her to justify her decision.', 'At Crisis Text Line, we do active rescues every night. This means that we send emergency personnel to the homes of someone who is in the middle of a suicide attempt in an effort to save their lives. Sometimes, we succeed. Sometimes, we don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs heartbreaking work. As word of 13 Reasons Why got out and people started watching the show, our numbers went through the roof. We were drowning in young people referencing the show, signaling how it had given them a framework for ending their lives. We panicked. All hands on deck. As we got things under control, I got angry. What the hell was Netflix thinking?', 'Researchers know the data on suicide and media. The more the media normalizes suicide, the more suicide is put into people‚Äôs head as a possibility, the more people who are on the edge start to take it seriously and consider it for themselves. After early media effects research was published, journalists developed best practices to minimize their coverage of suicide. As Joan Donovan often discusses, this form of ‚Äústrategic silence‚Äù was viable in earlier media landscapes; it‚Äôs a lot harder now. Today, journalists and media makers feel as though the fact that anyone could talk about suicide on the internet means that they should have a right to do so too.', 'We know that you can‚Äôt combat depression through rational discourse. Addressing depression is hard work. And I‚Äôm deeply concerned that we don‚Äôt have the foggiest clue how to approach the media landscape today. I‚Äôm confident that giving grounded people tools to think smarter can be effective. But I‚Äôm not convinced that we know how to educate people who do not share our epistemological frame. I‚Äôm not convinced that we know how to undo gaslighting. I‚Äôm not convinced that we understand how engaging people about the media intersects with those struggling with mental health issues. And I‚Äôm not convinced that we‚Äôve even begun to think about the unintended consequences of our good ‚Äî let alone naive ‚Äî intentions.', 'In other words, I think that there are a lot of assumptions baked into how we approach educating people about sensitive issues and our current media crisis has made those painfully visible.', 'Oh, and by the way, the Netflix TV show ends by setting up Season 2 to start with a school shooting. WTF, Netflix?', 'So what role do educators play in grappling with the contemporary media landscape? What kind of media literacy makes sense? To be honest, I don‚Äôt know. But it‚Äôs unfair to end a talk like this without offering some path forward so I‚Äôm going to make an educated guess.', 'I believe that we need to develop antibodies to help people not be deceived.', 'That‚Äôs really tricky because most people like to follow their gut more than than their mind. No one wants to hear that they‚Äôre being tricked. Still, I think there might be some value in helping people understand their own psychology.', 'Consider the power of nightly news and talk radio person",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lities. If you bring Sean Hannity, Rachel Maddow, or any other host into your home every night, you start to appreciate how they think. You may not agree with them, but you build a cognitive model of their words such that they have a coherent logic to them. They become real to you, even if they don‚Äôt know who you are. This is what scholars call ‚Äúparasocial interaction.‚Äù And the funny thing about human psychology is that we trust people who we invest our energies into understanding. That‚Äôs why bridging difference requires humanizing people across viewpoints.', 'Empathy is a powerful emotion, one that most educators want to encourage. But when you start to empathize with worldviews that are toxic, it‚Äôs very hard to stay grounded. It requires deep cognitive strength. Scholars who spend a lot of time trying to understand dangerous worldviews work hard to keep their emotional distance. One very basic tactic is to separate the different signals. Just read the text rather than consume the multimedia presentation of that. Narrow the scope. Actively taking things out of context can be helpful for analysis precisely because it creates a cognitive disconnect. This is the opposite of how most people encourage everyday analysis of media, where the goal is to appreciate the context first. Of course, the trick here is wanting to keep that emotional distance. Most people aren‚Äôt looking for that.', 'I also believe that it‚Äôs important to help students truly appreciate epistemological differences. In other words, why do people from different worldviews interpret the same piece of content differently? Rather than thinking about the intention behind the production, let‚Äôs analyze the contradictions in the interpretation. This requires developing a strong sense of how others think and where the differences in perspective lie. From an educational point of view, this means building the capacity to truly hear and embrace someone else‚Äôs perspective and teaching people to understand another‚Äôs view while also holding their view firm. It‚Äôs hard work, an extension of empathy into a practice that is common among ethnographers. It‚Äôs also a skill that is honed in many debate clubs. The goal is to understand the multiple ways of making sense of the world and use that to interpret media. Of course, appreciating the view of someone who is deeply toxic isn‚Äôt always psychologically stabilizing.', 'Another thing I recommend is to help students see how they fill in gaps when the information presented to them is sparse and how hard it is to overcome priors. Conversations about confirmation bias are important here because it‚Äôs important to understand what information we accept and what information we reject. Selective attention is another tool, most famously shown to students through the ‚Äúgorilla experiment.‚Äù If you aren‚Äôt familiar with this experiment, it involves showing a basketball video and focusing on counting passes made by people in one color shirt and then asking if they saw the gorilla. Many people do not. Inverting these cognitive science exercises, asking students to consider different fan fiction that fills in the gaps of a story with divergent explanations is another way to train someone to recognize how their brain fills in gaps.', 'What‚Äôs common about the different approaches I‚Äôm suggesting is that they are designed to be cognitive strengthening exercises, to help students recognize their own fault lines, not the fault lines of the media landscape around them. I can imagine that this too could be called media literacy and if you want to bend your definition that way, I‚Äôll accept it. But the key is to realize the humanity in ourselves and in others. We cannot and should not assert authority over epistemology, but we can encourage our students to be more aware of how interpretation is socially constructed. And to understand how that can be manipulated. Of course, just because you know you‚Äôre being manipulated doesn‚Äôt mean that you can resist it. And that‚Äôs where my proposal starts to get shaky.', 'Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî our information landscape is going to get more and more complex. Educators have a critical role to play in helping individuals and societies navigate what we encounter. But the path forward isn‚Äôt about doubling down on what constitutes a fact or teaching people to assess sources. Rebuilding trust in institutions and information intermediaries is important, but we can‚Äôt assume the answer is teaching students to rely on those signals. The first wave of media literacy was responding to propaganda in a mass media context. We live in a world of networks now. We need to understand how those networks are intertwined and how information that spreads through dyadic ‚Äî even if asymmetric ‚Äî encounters is understood and experienced differently than that which is produced and disseminated through mass media.', 'Above all, we need to recognize that information can, is, and will be weaponized in new ways. Today‚Äôs propagandist messages are no longer simply created by Madison Avenue or Edward Bernays-style State campaigns. For the last 15 years, a cohort of young people has learned how to hack the attention economy in an effort to have power and status in this new information ecosystem. These aren‚Äôt just any youth. They are young people who are disenfranchised, who feel as though the information they‚Äôre getting isn‚Äôt fulfilling, who struggle to feel powerful. They are trying to make sense of an unstable world and trying to respond to it in a way that is personally fulfilling. Most youth are engaged in invigorating activities. Others are doing the same things youth have always done. But there are youth out there who feel alienated and disenfranchised, who distrust the system and want to see it all come down. Sometimes, this frustration leads to productive ends. Often it does not. But until we start understanding their response to our media society, we will not be able to produce responsible interventions. So I would argue that we need to start developing a networked response to this networked landscape. And it starts by understanding different ways of constructing knowledge.', 'Special thanks to Monica Bulger, Mimi Ito, Whitney Phillips, Cathy Davidson, Sam Hinds Garcia, Frank Shaw, and Alondra
